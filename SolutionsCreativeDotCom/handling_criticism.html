<p>Criticism is inevitable whether it&#39;s justified or not, so expect your creative solutions to be criticized.</p><p>History is filled with examples of much-appreciated innovations that initially have been heavily criticized.&#160; Consider these examples:</p><ul><li>Many established chemists strongly opposed Dmitry Mendeleyev&#39;s periodic table of elements when he first introduced it.</li><li>The first steamboat in the United States, built by Robert Fulton, was called &#8220;Fulton&#39;s folly.&#8221;</li><li>Outrage was a common initial response to translating the Bible into languages that people could read.</li><li>It took 56 years after Dom Perignon invented champagne (in 1714) for the French to decide they liked it.</li><li>Fannie Farmer&#39;s <i>Boston Cooking School Cook Book</i> initially was controversial because the recipes used quantities such as one cup instead of one handful.</li><li style="page-break-before:avoid;">Eastman Kodak Company rejected Edwin Land&#39;s idea for an instant camera.&#160; So Land started his own business, Polaroid, which became a major competitor to Kodak.</li></ul><p>The list could go on and on, but you get the point.&#160; Typically criticisms of your idea will persist until your creative idea has demonstrated its value.&#160; As Mark Twain said, &#8220;The man with an original idea is a crank until the idea succeeds.&#8221;</p><p>Why do people resist change?&#160; Here are some common reasons:</p><ul><li style="page-break-after:avoid;">A change introduces the risk of things getting worse, instead of better.</li><li>Making a change always requires mental effort and usually requires physical effort.</li><li style="page-break-before:avoid;">Some people aren&#39;t bothered by the current situation.&#160; Usually a problem has to become quite annoying before people are interested in making a change.</li></ul><p>Now that you&#39;re prepared to expect criticism, how can you handle it?&#160; The secret is to realize <b>there are different kinds of criticism, each of which is best handled differently</b>.</p><p>Consider the innovation of printing Universal Product Code (UPC) labels on grocery items.&#160; This innovation eliminates the need to put price tags on the items.&#160; The stripes of the UPC code represent, to a computer, a number that&#39;s different for each kind of item.&#160; For instance item number 111943504863 might be a 16 ounce can of green beans from the Pick-a-Bean company.&#160; Notice that the item&#39;s price isn&#39;t included in the code.&#160; Yet when people first heard that the UPC bar code eliminated the need for price tags, many people assumed that the code included the item&#39;s price.&#160; So a common criticism was, &#8220;That&#39;s no good because the price can&#39;t be changed easily.&#8221;&#160; This is an example of a criticism that&#39;s <i>not valid</i>.&#160; Not only is the item&#39;s price not printed on the label, but the price, which is stored in an on-site computer, can be changed faster than someone can take an item off the shelf and get it to the checkout counter.</p><p>When someone criticizes a creative idea you suggest and the <b>criticism is <i>not valid</i></b>, recognize that there&#39;s <b>no evidence of a need to change the idea itself</b> &#8212; although you might want to <b>improve how you explain your idea</b>.</p><p>Suppose that, instead of the above scheme, the original plan for Universal Product Codes had been to put the item&#39;s price into the bar code.&#160; Many people would have appropriately criticized this idea by saying, &#8220;That&#39;s no good because the price can&#39;t be changed easily.&#8221;&#160; This would have been a <i>valid</i> criticism.</p><p>When someone criticizes your creative solution and the <b>criticism is <i>valid</i></b>, you should improve your solution.&#160; Specifically <b>refine your idea to eliminate the flaw or weakness</b> that&#39;s been appropriately criticized.</p><p>If someone responds to your idea with &#8220;I don&#39;t like it&#8221; or &#8220;It won&#39;t work,&#8221; notice that the feedback is <i>judgmental</i> (relating to opinion).&#160; <b>Judgmental criticism</b> conveys an opinion of badness (in contrast to goodness), but alone <b>doesn&#39;t provide information that indicates whether the judgment is valid</b>.</p><p>An example of judgmental criticism would be someone saying &#8220;It won&#39;t work&#8221; to the UPC bar code innovation in its early stages.&#160; This opinion would have failed to provide enough information to determine whether the person saw a genuine flaw.</p><p>To deal with a <b>judgmental criticism</b> such as &#8220;It won&#39;t work!,&#8221; <b>ask the critic</b> &#8220;What part of the idea won&#39;t work?&#8221; or &#8220;Why won&#39;t it work?&#8221;&#160; Do so <b>with a genuine desire to determine whether they&#39;ve seen something you&#39;ve overlooked</b>.&#160; Based on the critic&#39;s reply, hopefully you will be able to determine whether their criticism is valid or not.&#160; For example, if the critic says &#8220;It won&#39;t work when too many people are involved&#8221; and you realize that, indeed, it won&#39;t work in that case, the critic has revealed a flaw worth eliminating.</p><p>Ironically <b>the most useful kind of criticism is</b> the one that&#39;s hardest to accept: <b><i>specific valid</i> criticism</b>.&#160; Such feedback reveals you haven&#39;t yet finished refining your solution, and this is disappointing to realize.&#160; Yet such criticisms are the most useful because they reveal flaws or weaknesses that later would create new problems to resolve.</p><p>Often when a critic is asked to be more specific about a judgmental criticism, heshe won&#39;t be able to do so.&#160; The critic might say something like, &#8220;I just know it won&#39;t work.&#8221;&#160; In such situations accept that the person is either unable or unwilling to offer you useful insights.</p><p>Here&#39;s a summary of the three kinds of criticism explained so far:</p><ul><li>Criticism type:&#160; <b>Valid</b>.&#160; The criticism includes enough information to indicate that, indeed, there&#39;s a flaw or weakness in the idea. &#8212; Appropriate response:&#160; <b>Refine the idea</b> to eliminate the flaw or weakness, but without losing it&#39;s advantages.</li><li>Criticism type: <b>Not valid</b>.&#160; Your idea clearly doesn&#39;t have the disadvantage the critic claims it does. &#8212; Appropriate response:&#160; <b>Improve your ability to explain the idea</b> to avoid future misunderstandings.&#160; Apparently the critic doesn&#39;t completely understand the idea.</li><li>Criticism type:&#160; <b>Judgmental</b>.&#160; The reaction to the idea is negative, but there isn&#39;t enough information to indicate whether the negative reaction is valid or not. &#8212; Appropriate response:&#160; <b>Ask the critic for more specific information</b> in hopes of learning whether hisher criticism is valid.</li></ul><p>Valid, invalid, and judgmental criticisms aren&#39;t the only kinds of criticisms you&#39;ll hear.&#160; Someone might say, &#8220;You&#39;re a foolish person&#8221; or &#8220;Gosh you&#39;re stupid!&#8221;&#160; Notice that <b>these are criticisms of you, not your idea</b>.&#160; The integrity of your idea remains unshaken.</p><p>If your personal integrity is shaken by this kind of criticism, you might want to <b>boost your self-confidence and self-esteem</b>.&#160; In case you don&#39;t know how, here are some suggestions and a clarification.</p><ul><li>Actions are more powerful than words, so focus attention on successfully accomplishing tasks that <i>directly</i> give <i>you</i> a sense of satisfaction, pride, and fulfillment.</li><li>If you fear specific kinds of situations, focus on improving skills that are useful for handling those situations.&#160; <b>If problems are what you fear, put extra effort into improving your creative-problem-solving skills</b>.</li><li>Only a few fortunate people have solid self-confidence and inherently high self-esteem.&#160; Many people who appear to be highly self-confident are not.&#160; For example some people who talk loudly are compensating for a hearing impairment, and many people who seek opportunities to be on stage in front of an audience use the audience appreciation to indirectly boost their self-esteem.</li></ul><p>A comment that can arise in the early stages of trying to solve a problem is, &#8220;It can&#39;t be done.&#8221;&#160; Don&#39;t worry.&#160; Simply <b>translate this sentence into what it really means, which is, &#8220;It hasn&#39;t been done yet.&#8221;</b></p><p>When you suggest an idea and are told &#8220;We&#39;ve already tried that,&#8221; ask the person what was tried.&#160; What&#39;s been tried might be similar to, yet significantly different from, what you have in mind.&#160; If you&#39;re sure that your idea will work even though their attempt failed, point out the feature in your idea that will make the difference.</p><p>Occasionally someone will compliment your idea!&#160; When they do, notice whether it&#39;s judgmental or specific.&#160; If their compliment is specific, such as &#8220;I like the fact that a thief won&#39;t even notice that he&#39;s leaving evidence,&#8221; then keep this compliment in mind when you consider changing your idea to remove other flaws.&#160; On the other hand, if the compliment is judgmental, such as &#8220;Hey, I like that idea!,&#8221; then smile, appreciate the good feeling, and remember this appreciation for later when you find yourself in the midst of invalid and judgmental criticisms.</p><p>Now that you&#39;re armed with strategies for handling criticism, ask for opinions from people whose judgment is usually reliable.&#160; But don&#39;t ask for feedback when an idea is still fresh and therefore fragile.&#160; Nor should you postpone asking for feedback until after you&#39;ve committed yourself to implementing a creative idea exactly as planned.&#160; Instead ask for opinions from friends or associates while you&#39;re still willing to make changes, but after you&#39;ve built up some confidence in your idea.</p><p><b>Your goal in seeking opinions should be to get help seeing flaws you&#39;ve overlooked</b>.&#160; To accomplish this goal, focus on what the criticism or complement reveals &#8212; instead of simply focusing on whether the reaction is positive or negative.</p><h3>SUMMARY</h3><p>Your creative solutions will be criticized whether they deserve criticism or not.&#160; What matters isn&#39;t how enthusiastically your creative solutions are welcomed, but rather, do they work?&#160; Distinguish between valid, invalid, and judgmental criticism.&#160; Valid criticisms, although hardest to accept, are the most valuable &#8212; if you act on them by further refining your solution.&#160; Respond to invalid criticism by improving your explanation of your solution.</p>
