VoteFair ranking, which is a method of calculating a fair, overall order of preference when voters indicate 
not only their first choice, but their second choice, third choice, etc.  This voting method is described at <a href="http://www.VoteFair.org">www.VoteFair.org</a>. &nbsp; It was first described, very briefly, in <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>. &nbsp; Also, it was mentioned in the <i>Futurist</i> magazine article. &nbsp; Its advantages are described in
<a href="voteadv.html">a chapter within the online book titled<i>Hope for the Future</i>.</a></li>

<li>
A phonetic sign language is described on pages 272 to 277 of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>.  This new kind of sign language would represent spoken sounds as hand signs.  Unlike finger spelling, there would be a one-to-one correlation between hand signs and spoken sounds.  It would be very easy-to-learn.  In addition to increasing communication with deaf and voiceless people, it would be used by unhandicapped people to communicate across a noisy hall, across a quiet concert hall, on opposite sides of a window, and underwater.  Furthermore, electronic equipment could translate spoken sounds into hand signs for a deaf person, and could translate a voiceless person's hand signs into spoken sounds.</li>

mentioned in the <i>Futurist</i> magazine article.</li>
