<B>
1
</B>
: Opening The Toolbox
</h3>

<p>In this chapter you'll discover the nature of creative problem solving and how it's related to decision-making, innovation, inventing, and tradition.

<p>

<center>
<h1>
<strong>
Part One: The Basic Tools</strong></h1>

<p>Chapters 2 through 5 contain the tools that are easier to understand
<br />
and apply.  These tools also are the most crucial ones.

</center>

<p>

<h3>
<B>
2
</B>
: Welcoming New Ideas
</h3>

<p>Here are some of the most important thinking skills needed for creative problem solving, including how to prompt new ideas and how to welcome them when they arrive.

<p>

<h3>
<B>
3
</B>
: Reconsidering Your Goals
</h3>

<p>Goals exist whether you're aware of them or not, and they influence your thinking in surprising and subtle ways.  Identifying goals can be done in ways that expand, instead of limit, possibilities.
<p>

<h3>
<B>
4
</B>
: Exploring Your Many Alternatives
</h3>

<p>When you use the tools in this chapter you'll have too many, not too few, ideas for how to solve a problem.  Also included is a tool for using those many ideas to arrive at a single, better solution and suggestions for where to start solving a problem.
<p>

<h3>
<B>5</B>: Refining Your Ideas
</h3>

<p>Creative ideas typically arrive in a crude and impractical form, so refinement, which transforms rough new ideas into practical solutions, is essential.
<p>

<center>

<h1>
<strong>
Part Two: The Advanced Tools
</strong>
</h1>

<p>The remainder of this book presents the kinds of tools that tend to be
<br />
more challenging to understand and apply.  The division of this book into halves
<br />
should not be interpreted as an actual gap in the nature of creative problem solving.
<br />
Instead, you can think of this as a good place to pause
<br />
after reading Part One.

</center>

<p>

<h3>
<B>
6
</B>
: Thinking In Alternate Ways
</h3>

<p>Schools heavily emphasize thinking in words and numbers.  But there are many other useful ways to think, including thinking visually, thinking in concepts, and using your intuition.
<p>

<h3>
<B>
7
</B>
: Thinking Dimensionally
</h3>

<p>Of course dimensions include quantities such as weight and money that can be measured in numbers.  But other dimensions that defy being measured, such as love, risk, and assertiveness, are a part of virtually every real problem.  Developing a clear understanding of a problem's dimensions frequently reveals a creative solution.
<p>

<h3>
<B>
8
</B>
: Understanding Clearly
</h3>

<p>A failure to reach a clear understanding lies at the root of most unsolved problems.  Here are tips for seeking out clear understandings that, almost by themselves, make solutions obvious.  As a test of your clarity of understanding, do you already understand the main difference between anger and fear?
<p>

<h3>
<B>
9
</B>
: Considering Your Goals Some More
</h3>

<p>Going beyond the suggestions in Chapter 3, here are some advanced suggestions about clarifying goals.
<p>

<h3>
<B>
10
</B>
: Taking Action
</h3>

<p>Once you've created a solution worth acting on, you must prepare to handle the criticisms and resistance your improvement is likely to provoke.  Also, there are important attitudes about action that, as a thinker, you may not already know.
<p>

<h3>
<B>
11
</B>
: Using The Creative Problem Solver's Tools
</h3>

<p>Tools sitting unused in a toolbox are of little value.  Here are tips for applying the tools to solve specific problems, teaching children how to solve problems creatively, inventing, and avoiding problems that are now heading your way.
<p>

<h3>
<B>
12
</B>
: Closing The Toolbox
</h3>

<p>The book closes with a brief reminder of a few highlights and a list of suggested sources of additional information about creative problem solving.
