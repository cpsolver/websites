<h2>Quotations About<br /> <EM>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</EM></h2>
</center>
<p><CITE>Over the years, I've collected numerous resources for effective problem solving: articles, books, software, card decks, and more.&nbsp; But if there was only one resource I could take to the proverbial desert island, it would be this book: The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox, by Richard Fobes.&nbsp; It truly is a toolbox full of techniques, and the examples can make it fascinating to read.&nbsp; Amazon carries it (but is out of stock, as of this writing), or the author will actually ship it to you for free. Then you can either return the book or a check in payment.&nbsp; Unusual, yes?&nbsp; So is the book.&nbsp; (FYI, I don't get any cut of the purchase price :).</CITE><p><blockquote>Terry Masters</blockquote><hr width=65% align=center /><p>

<CITE>I absolutely love this book.&nbsp;  As I read it, I keep thinking, “Why doesn't the rest of the world know about this book?!”&nbsp;  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to drastically increase their ability to create solutions to all kinds of problems. &nbsp; Creative problem solving is my passion, and I was a skilled problem-solver even before I bought this book, yet it's taken my problem-solving abilities to an even higher level. &nbsp; This book is complete and practical.&nbsp;  I can't think of a single reason why you shouldn't buy it.&nbsp;  You'll be pleasantly surprised when you receive it.</CITE>

<CITE>The book is subtitled <i>A Complete Course in the Art of Creating Solutions to Problems of Any Kind</i> and it certainly lives up to that billing.  This is a book you should have in your reference library.  ...  [The author] made a special effort to make the subject clear and easy to follow.  He uses lots of examples and exercises on a variety of real world problems.  He avoids any "mumbo-jumbo" and does not try to make simple tools seem overly complex (like many authors in the field).  In fact, Richard used the creativity tools to make the book the most user-friendly I have ever seen.  Anyone who has to prepare written instructions would benefit from studying and "borrowing" the concepts he uses to write this book. ...  This [radial outline] tool can be used by an individual or group and yields better results than brainstorming.</CITE>
