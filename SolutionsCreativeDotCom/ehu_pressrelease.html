<i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>
</h1>


<p>Frustrated voters can now take action to reduce the big gap between what voters want and politicians do.  A new book titled <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i> explains how VoteFair ranking can reduce a hidden unfairness in U.S. elections.  The unfairness is hidden in primary elections where the winner is always from the right party, but is often disliked by a majority of the voters.  Traditional single-mark ballots don't provide information about secondary preferences, so the frequent lack of majority support for the winner of a primary election typically goes unnoticed.</p>

<p>VoteFair ranking makes use of order-of-preference ballots that allow each voter to indicate not only a first choice, but also a second choice, third choice, and so on.  VoteFair ranking counts these ballots in a way that not only correctly identifies which candidate is most popular, but also indicates which candidate is second-most popular, which candidate is third-most popular, and so on.</p>

<p>An existing voting method called instant runoff voting also uses ballots that collect secondary preferences, but voting experts acknowledge that sometimes instant runoff voting identifies the wrong winner.  The book's author, Richard Fobes, says "VoteFair ranking takes into account all the preferences of all the voters, which makes the results fairer than instant runoff voting, which only considers some of the secondary preferences of some of the voters."</p>

<p><i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i> contains 85 illustrations of candidates, ballots, voters, and voter preferences that clearly show the unfairnesses of current voting methods and the fairness of VoteFair ranking.  The book also contains eight cartoons and a poem.</p>

<p>At the front of the book are suggestions for how to read only portions of the book.  The suggestions include reading the introductory chapter that summarizes the book's most important points, just reading the two chapters that explain order-of-preference ballots and VoteFair ranking, just reading the chapters that explain how U.S. Presidential elections can be improved, or just reading the closing chapter that takes a peek into the future to reveal the increased economic prosperity that will flourish under fairer voting methods.</p>

<p>VoteFair ranking originated in the mind of Richard Fobes while he was writing his book titled <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox.</i>  He tested his creative-problem-solving skills on political problems, realized that existing voting methods are too primitive for fair results, and developed the new method he named VoteFair ranking.</p>

<p>Additional information about <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i> is available at Amazon.com and SolutionsCreative.com.</p>

<p>The longer you wait to tell others about this book and VoteFair ranking, the longer we must put up with special-interest puppets instead of voter-chosen leaders.</p>
