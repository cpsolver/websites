<p>We are stuck in a bad feedback loop that steals money from us, the majority of voters, while it financially rewards the biggest election-campaign contributors. Learn how these campaign contributors exploit our primitive elections using the money tactics of blocking, splitting, and concentration. And learn how better election methods are being hidden from us. Most importantly, learn the simple steps that will take us to full democracy and widespread economic prosperity.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/wage_gap_tax.html">Wage Gap Tax</a></h2>

<p>If elections were fair, what would change?&nbsp;
The huge wage gap between essential workers and their managers
in large corporations would be reduced.&nbsp; But instead of
trying to do this by penalizing businesses that fail to pay the minimum wage,
we should tax large businesses according to the size of the gap
between the lower half of their employees and the upper half of their employees.&nbsp;
A proposal to accomplish this change is presented as the
<a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/wage_gap_tax.html">Wage Gap Tax</a>.&nbsp; Please take a look at this long-overdue reform.</p>

It eliminates &ldquo;pairwise losing candidates&rdquo; and then, when an elimination round does not have that kind of losing candidate, it eliminates the candidate using simple &ldquo;ranked choice&rdquo; vote counting.

<h2><a href="https://electowiki.org/wiki/Instant_Pairwise_Elimination">Instant Pairwise Elimination (IPE) is simple, yet better than IRV</a></h2>

<p>This new vote-counting method gives much better results than &ldquo;instant-runoff voting&rdquo; (IRV),
and it's almost as easy to understand.&nbsp; Here is its description:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voters rank the candidates using up to 7 ranking levels (or 5 ranking levels if ovals are marked on a paper ballot and space is limited).&nbsp; During counting, each elimination round eliminates the candidate who has the largest pairwise opposition count, which is determined by counting on each ballot the number of not-yet-eliminated candidates who are ranked above that candidate, and adding those numbers across all the ballots.&nbsp; The last remaining candidate wins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://electowiki.org/wiki/Instant_Pairwise_Elimination">Instant Pairwise Elimination (IPE)</a></p>

<p>And there is a &ldquo;proportional&rdquo; variation of this method called
<a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/representative_instant_pairwise_elimination.html">Representative Instant Pairwise Elimination (RIPE)</a>.&nbsp;

<h2>Tax the takers more than the makers</h2>

<p>If elections were fair &mdash; which they aren't because governmental elections use single-mark ballots &mdash; what would change?&nbsp; One change
would be to make taxes fairer, simplify the tax code, and eliminate tax loopholes.&nbsp;
A proposal that would implement such changes by increasing taxes for &ldquo;taker&rdquo; businesses and reducing taxes
for &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses is presented as the <a href="http://www.SolutionsCreative.com/tax_takers_more_than_makers.html">Tax The Takers More Than Makers Taxation Reform</a>.&nbsp;

<h2>What are the &ldquo;99%&rdquo; and &ldquo;Occupy Wall Street&rdquo; movements overlooking?</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;Occupy Wall Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;99%&rdquo; movements realize that money has excessive influence in politics,
but they have not yet realized that the 1% easily outvotes the 99% because elections use single-mark ballots,
and that this unfairness allows the 1% to take advantage of vote splitting that happens &mdash;
either unintentionally or planned &mdash; in <b>primary</b> elections.&nbsp;
The unfairness is hidden because single-mark ballots do not collect enough information to reveal
which candidate is really the most popular, and because the winner of every <b>primary</b> election 
is always from the correct political party.</p>

<p>The way to solve this unfairness is to ban single-mark ballots from Congressional elections!</p>
