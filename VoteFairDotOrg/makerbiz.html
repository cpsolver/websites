<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>


<p>It's easy to overlook the fact that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses bring large amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.</p>

<p>In contrast, the value of large &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses is obvious.&nbsp; That's why special tax breaks are given to large maker businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI.</p>

<p>Why are &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses so important?&nbsp; If suddenly all of Oregon lost all its maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, Oregon's economy would collapse.&nbsp; Money would stop flowing into Oregon from outside of Oregon.&nbsp; Oregon's other businesses would have no customers, and no money to pay their employees.&nbsp; City and state government agencies, including police departments, would have no funding.&nbsp; At that point our current levels of homelessness, crime, lawlessness, drug abuse, and mental illness would be remembered fondly as a much better time.</p>

<p>Wisely, tax breaks are given to large maker businesses so they won't move to another city or state.&nbsp; And so they can more easily grow, acquire more customers, and hire more employees.&nbsp; Yet foolishly, tax breaks for small maker businesses are overlooked.</p>

<p>It's time for politicians to fear the loss of small maker businesses as much as they fear the loss of a big maker business such as Nike or OMSI.&nbsp; They need to be reminded that small maker businesses collectively attract as much money into Oregon as one of Oregon's larger businesses.</p>

<p>To further understand why maker businesses are so important to Portland's economy, look at the following diagram.&nbsp; It clarifies that money flows to non&#8209;maker businesses only after passing through maker businesses.</p>


<h2 class="table_title">Business types</h2>

<h2>Small maker</h2>
<p>Attract lots of money from outside Portland.&nbsp; Yet small maker businesses pay the same high business tax rates as non&#8209;maker businesses, which do not attract much money from outside Portland.</p>
<p>These businesses should be getting a tax break to make it easier for them to sell more to more customers, hire more employees, and hopefully pay higher wages.&nbsp; The result will be more money paid in taxes, and more money flowing to other Portland businesses.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;ZGF Architects, Tripwire, Mother's Bistro, Le Pigeon, Seasons & Regions, Andina, Portland City Grill, Annie Bloom's Books, etc.</p></p>
        </td><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Large maker</h2>
<p>Attract lots of money from outside Portland.&nbsp; Then this money flows to employees, other businesses, and the business owners.</p>

<h2>Large non&#8209;maker</h2>

<p>What qualifies a business as a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; business?&nbsp; The following list describes some key characteristics of a maker business, and its opposite, which is a &ldquo;taker&rdquo; business.&nbsp; The list also describes the in&#8209;between &ldquo;other&rdquo; category, and the remaining category of governments and non&#8209;profit organizations.</p>

<p>As you read these category descriptions, remember that money flows through the top &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses before reaching the businesses in the lower categories.&nbsp; And remember that tax revenues to city and state governments arrive only after the money has passed through at least one business.</p>

<p class="cell_content_left">Maker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>&ldquo;Maker&rdquo; businesses earn most of their income from customers who do not live near the business.&nbsp; They do that by making unique things of value that previously did not already exist.&nbsp; These unique things have extra value because they are not available from other businesses in other states.</p>
<p>Most maker businesses, such as Intel and Tripwire, make products and services and send them to customers in other states, and sometimes to customers in other nations.&nbsp; Other maker businesses, such as OMSI and single&#8209;location restaurants, create a unique experience that attracts the customer to the business location.</p>
<p>Not including taxes, all the money that flows into a maker business flows out to its employees, suppliers, and business owners.&nbsp; From there the money flows to other businesses, to taker businesses, and to individuals.</p>
        </td></tr>

<p class="cell_content_left">Other businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #ffffaa;">
<p>Businesses that are between the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;taker&rdquo; extremes typically do not make anything that didn't already exist.&nbsp; If they do make something, that product or service would not have value to customers outside the state, or else similar businesses in other states sell something similar to Oregon customers.</p>
<p>As a result, these in&#8209;between businesses do not bring a net flow of money into Oregon from outside of Oregon.</p>
<p>This category includes teaching, maintenance, healthcare, transportation, communication, retail, and sales.</p>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Taker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;">
<p>Taker businesses mostly transfer ownership of what already exists.&nbsp; If they do make something, what they make would not be of value outside Oregon, or else similar products and services are available in nearly every other state within the United States.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses drain or waste resources such as money, brainpower, and physical labor.&nbsp; Some taker businesses remove money from the local economy and send that money to their headquarters.&nbsp; And some taker businesses export natural resources to customers outside the state, which leaves less resources for future generations.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses give lots of money to political candidates because the decisions made by elected officials strongly affect how much these businesses earn.&nbsp; Often this regulation is needed because it would be easy for some taker businesses to defraud its customers, such as by running a financial business as a ponzi scheme.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaaaff;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Government entities and non&#8209;profit organizations</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaaaff;">

<p>In other words, maker businesses are the bottleneck for economic growth.</p>

<p>Also notice that maker businesses are easy to identify.&nbsp; Qualifying for the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit will be based on the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code number written on the company's IRS tax form, and based on their employee count.&nbsp; Also the business must specify the domain name for the company's website, and in some cases that website might be looked at to verify they sell a product or service or experience that has value to customers outside the Portland area.</p>

<p>Farms and ranches are the most basic kinds of maker businesses.&nbsp; Yet small farms and ranches would not qualify for the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax break.&nbsp; That's because they already get lots of industry-specific tax breaks.&nbsp; In fact, they get their own IRS tax forms.</p>

<p>Factories are the next&#8209;most basic kind of maker business.&nbsp; During the 1950s and 1960s factories and factory jobs provided a high level of economic prosperity for the United States and Canada.&nbsp; At that time unemployment was very low, homelessness was rare, and police officers were able to maintain &ldquo;law and order.&rdquo; That experience should have revealed the importance of maker businesses.&nbsp; Alas, for North Americans, those decades of prosperity began to end in the 1970s when other industrial nations finished building factories that replaced the ones that were bombed during world war two.&nbsp; That's when North America lost its temporary monopoly on unbombed factories.</p>

<p>The United States experienced another surge in economic prosperity through the growth of computer-based &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses such as Intel, Microsoft, and Apple.&nbsp; That prosperity has declined now that maker businesses in other nations also make high-tech hardware and software products and services.</p>

<p>The arrival of software technology has shifted many maker businesses from relying on the US patent system to relying on the US copyright system.&nbsp; This shift away from factories also accounts for why small software-based maker businesses have been overlooked as engines of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Why else is this &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax-break path to economic prosperity so easily overlooked?&nbsp; Politicians tend to focus on the business owners who give them the biggest campaign contributions.&nbsp; Of course these biggest campaign contributors happen to be the ones whose income is most strongly affected by laws and taxes.</p>

<p>Small maker businesses don't have enough time or money to get special attention from politicians.&nbsp; And, unlike taker businesses, maker businesses earn money in ways that do not require gaining special advantages through special laws.&nbsp; So the owners of maker businesses have not spent much time or money pushing politicians for those special laws.</p>

<p>To better appreciate why small maker businesses are overlooked as an important economic engine, look at which kinds of organizations are represented in the Portland economic task force.&nbsp; Only two small maker businesses are represented.</p>

<p>It's time for the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature to recognize the wisdom of nurturing small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses with a &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.&nbsp; Especially it's time to stop short-sightedly exploiting them with the same high business tax rates that are easily affordable for law firms, financial institutions, and many other non-maker businesses.&nbsp; The increased money that small maker businesses will bring into Portland will quickly flow to those other kinds of businesses.</p>

<p>There's yet another advantage of the makerbiz tax credit.&nbsp; It will help some women entrepreneurs, and minority entrepreneurs, to grow their small maker business without the cost of administering yet another taxpayer&#8209;funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here's a link to a webpage that explains the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit in more detail, along with two other overdue economic reforms:</p>

<h2 class="text_center"><a href="votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb">votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb</a></h2>

<p>Instead of chasing away small maker businesses, both Portland and Oregon should give them lower effective tax rates to keep them here.&nbsp; Plus the lower taxes may attract yet more maker businesses from other states.&nbsp; Economic prosperity for Portland will follow.&nbsp; In turn, the economic prosperity will decrease unemployment, homelessness, drug abuse, and crime, which are symptoms of the underlying economic suffering now going on in Portland.</p>


<!--

<p>Already some small maker businesses have been leaving Portland to escape our relatively high business tax rates.&nbsp; And yet more of them are considering leaving.&nbsp; And many of the ones that remain in Portland are struggling financially.</p>


<p>When a maker business struggles, or fails, or leaves Oregon, there is a loss of tax revenue.&nbsp; When governmental agencies have less money, problems such as crime, drug abuse, and mental illness become harder to solve.</p>

<p>Even worse, the burden of high business taxes makes it harder for a business to grow.&nbsp; Yet growth of any business involves adding customers, adding employees, and paying more Oregon payroll taxes.</p>

<p>To help small maker businesses stay, and grow, both the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature should be giving them a tax break.</p>
