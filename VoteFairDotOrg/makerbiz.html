<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>

<p>It's obvious that Portland-area &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI bring lots of money into the Portland economy.&nbsp; So it's easy for them to arrange special tax breaks.</p>

<p>What gets overlooked is that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses such as small Portland manufacturers, software-based businesses, single-location restaurants (Le Pigeon, Portland City Grill, and hundreds more), local publishers, local self-employed artists and performers, and local performance venues also bring significant amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.</p>

<p>Portland has thousands of small maker businesses.&nbsp; To make it easier for them to grow, and to get more customers, and to hire more employees, they should be getting a special &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.&nbsp; Instead of arranging the makerbiz tax credit one business at a time, a small maker business will simply claim the tax credit on their business tax form.&nbsp; Qualification will be based on their NAISC code and, if needed, by looking at their public domain-specific website to verify they make and sell something that has value to customers outside the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>The makerbiz tax credit will slow down, and even reverse, the rate at which Portland maker businesses have been moving out of Portland to avoid Portland's high business tax rates, and to avoid Oregon's high business tax burden.&nbsp; Plus it will help some women and minority entrepreneurs to grow their business without the cost of administering yet another taxpayer-funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How important are maker businesses?&nbsp; If Portland, and Oregon, had no maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, all of Portland's real estate businesses, law firms, banks, and insurance companies would have no customers.&nbsp; And most mortgage-paying homeowners would become homeless.&nbsp; Burglary and robbery would become the most common profession.&nbsp; And police departments would be unable to protect independently wealthy residents and employees who remotely work for out-of-state businesses.&nbsp; In other words, the money earned by maker businesses is what powers our Oregon economy.&nbsp; Let's give all of them, not just the big ones, a tax break.&nbsp; This simple tax break will help them grow, and bring yet more money into the Oregon economy.</p>
