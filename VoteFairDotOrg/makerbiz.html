<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>

<p class="text_center font_size_author">Written by Richard Fobes</p>

<p class="text_center">The VoteFair guy,<br />author of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i><br />and <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i></p>

<p class="small_font text_center text_wide_margin">When you &ldquo;read&rdquo; this article the first time, just <span style="color:red;">skim</span> the paragraphs, and just <span style="color:red;">briefly</span> look at each list.&nbsp;  Later you can return to focus on any specific sections of interest.</p>



<p>It's easy to overlook the fact that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses bring large amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.</p>

<p>In contrast, the value of large &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses is obvious.&nbsp; That's why special tax breaks are given to large maker businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI.</p>

<p>Why are &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses so important?&nbsp; If suddenly all of Oregon lost all its maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, Oregon's economy would collapse.&nbsp; Money would stop flowing into Oregon from outside of Oregon.&nbsp; Oregon's other businesses would have no customers, and no money to pay their employees.&nbsp; City and state government agencies, including police departments, would have no funding.&nbsp; At that point our currently high levels of homelessness, crime, lawlessness, drug abuse, and mental illness would be remembered fondly as a much better time.</p>

<p>Wisely, tax breaks are given to large maker businesses so they won't move to another city or state.&nbsp; And so they can more easily grow, acquire more customers, and hire more employees.&nbsp; Yet foolishly, tax breaks for small maker businesses are overlooked.</p>

<p>It's time for politicians to fear the loss of small maker businesses as much as they fear the loss of a big maker business such as Nike or OMSI.&nbsp; More specifically, the Portland city council needs to realize that giving a tax break to small maker businesses will dramatically increase economic prosperity for Portland.&nbsp; And the Oregon state legislature needs to recognize that adopting this tax break at the state level will dramatically increase economic prosperity for both Portland and Oregon.</p>

<p>To better appreciate the importance of maker businesses, let's start by understanding that money flows to non&#8209;maker businesses only after first passing through maker businesses.&nbsp; The following diagram conveys this important concept.</p>


<h2 class="table_title">Business types</h2>

<table class="table_2_by_2" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <col width="50%">
    <col width="50%">
    <tbody>
        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_2_by_2" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;">
<h2>Small maker</h2>
<p>Attract lots of money from outside Portland.&nbsp; Yet small maker businesses pay the same high business tax rates as non&#8209;maker businesses, which do not attract much money from outside Portland.</p>
<p>These businesses should be getting a tax break to make it easier for them to sell more to more customers, hire more employees, and hopefully pay higher wages.&nbsp; The result will be more money paid in taxes, and more money flowing to other Portland businesses.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;<i><b>ZGF Architects</b></i>, <i>Tripwire</i>, <i>Puppet Software</i>, <i><b>Mother's Bistro</b></i>, <i>Le Pigeon</i>, <i>Seasons & Regions</i>, <i>Andina</i>, <i>Portland City Grill</i>, <i>Annie Bloom's Books</i>, etc.</p>
        </td><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Large maker</h2>
<p>Attract lots of money from outside Portland.&nbsp; Then this money flows to employees, other businesses, and the business owners.</p>
<p>Being the source of increased prosperity is rewarded with special tax breaks.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;<i><b>Columbia Sportswear</b></i>, <i><b>Ampere Computing</b></i>, <i>Laika</i>, <i><b>OMSI</b></i>, etc.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Small non&#8209;maker</h2>
<p>Most of their income arrives after first passing through maker businesses.&nbsp; So their prosperity is limited by the prosperity of maker businesses.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;Dental offices, retail stores, law firms, franchise locations, etc.</p>
        </td><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Large non&#8209;maker</h2>

<p>In other words, maker businesses are the bottleneck for economic growth.</p>

<p>What qualifies a business as a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; business?&nbsp; The following list describes some key characteristics of a maker business.&nbsp; For contrast, the list also describes the opposite kind of business, a &ldquo;taker&rdquo; business, and two other organization categories.</p>



<h2 class="table_title">Map of downward money flow</h2>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <col width="35%">
    <col width="65%">
    <tbody>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Maker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>&ldquo;Maker&rdquo; businesses earn most of their income from customers who do not live near the business.&nbsp; They do that by making unique things of value that previously did not already exist.&nbsp; These unique things have extra value because they are not available from other businesses in other states.</p>
<p>Most maker businesses, such as Intel and Tripwire, make products and services and send them to customers in other states, and sometimes to customers in other nations.&nbsp; Other maker businesses, such as OMSI and single&#8209;location restaurants, create a unique experience that attracts the customer to the business location.</p>
<p>Not including taxes, all the money that flows into a maker business flows out to its employees, suppliers, and business owners.&nbsp; From there the money flows to other businesses, to taker businesses, and to individuals.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #ffffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Other businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #ffffaa;">
<p>Businesses that are between the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;taker&rdquo; extremes typically do not make anything that didn't already exist.&nbsp; If they do make something, that product or service would not have value to customers outside the state, or else similar businesses in other states sell something similar to Oregon customers.</p>
<p>As a result, these in&#8209;between businesses do not bring a net flow of money into Oregon from outside of Oregon.</p>
<p>This category includes teaching, maintenance, healthcare, transportation, communication, retail, and sales.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Taker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;">
<p>Taker businesses mostly transfer ownership of what already exists.&nbsp; If they do make something, what they make would not be of value outside Oregon, or else similar products and services are available in nearly every other state within the United States.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses drain or waste resources such as money, brainpower, and physical labor.&nbsp; Some taker businesses remove money from the local economy and send that money to their headquarters.&nbsp; And some taker businesses export natural resources to customers outside the state, which leaves less resources for future generations.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses give lots of money to political candidates because the decisions made by elected officials strongly affect how much these businesses earn.&nbsp; This influence can easily lead to corruption, so lots of laws have been written to regulate specific kinds of taker businesses.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaaaff;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Government entities and non&#8209;profit organizations</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaaaff;">
<p>City and state governments get nearly all their tax revenue from businesses, employees, investors, and landowners who get their money only after it has passed through at least one maker business.</p>
<p>Governments pass along some of their tax revenues to non&#8209;profit organizations that attempt to solve problems such as crime, homelessness, and drug addiction.</p>
        </td></tr>

<p>Maker businesses are easy to identify.&nbsp; The NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code number written on the company's IRS tax form clearly identifies some businesses as &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses.&nbsp; The number also identifies some other businesses as non-maker businesses.</p>

<p>Farms and ranches are the most basic kinds of maker businesses.&nbsp; Yet farms and ranches, both big and small, already get lots of tax breaks, and even have their own special IRS tax forms.</p>

<p>Factories are the next&#8209;most basic kind of maker business.&nbsp; Large manufacturing businesses already get tax breaks to reward them for employing more employees and paying lots of payroll taxes.</p>

<p>What will be the criteria for being a &ldquo;small&rdquo; maker business?&nbsp; The company's employee count easily measures the size of the business.&nbsp; The tax break will smoothly decrease as the number of employees increases.&nbsp; For example a full tax break can decrease down to a zero tax break as the business grows from, say, 50 employees to 150 employees.</p>

<p>Additional business characteristics, such as the kind of product or service it makes, can be verified by looking at the company's website.&nbsp; If the business only uses a TikTok or Facebook page instead of a website, the business would not qualify for the tax break.</p>

<p>Probably the easiest kind of tax break to implement is a tax credit.&nbsp; Let's call it the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.</p>

<p>Claiming the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit must be easy.&nbsp; If the existing business tax form is well-designed, the tax credit would be entered on a generic line by specifying a special code number and the amount.&nbsp; The amount would be calculated on a separate worksheet using numbers that are already declared elsewhere on the standard business tax form.</p>

<p>Would this &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit really increase economic prosperity?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Would it decrease the unemployment rate and homelessness rate?&nbsp; That depends.&nbsp; If Oregon is the only state that adopts the makerbiz tax credit, the low unemployment rate and low homeless rate would attract more unemployed and homeless people from other states.</p>

<p>This brings us to the fact that Oregon is a state, not a nation, so there are some limits that become important to consider.&nbsp; The following list explains some of these limitations.</p>



<h2 class="table_title">Outside limits to increased prosperity</h2>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <col width="20%">
    <col width="75%">

<p class="cell_content_left">Climate</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>The relative warmth of the Pacific Ocean during winter gives the western parts of California, Washington, and Oregon less-harsh winters, which attracts homeless people from elsewhere in the United States.&nbsp; As Portland's economic prosperity increases, more homeless people will move to Portland to escape harsh winters.&nbsp; And to escape overcrowding of homeless camps and shelters in other states.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Immigration</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>Many nations south of the United States have high levels of violent crime and lots of economic hardships.&nbsp; People living in those nations will continue to be attracted to better conditions in the United States.&nbsp; Whether they arrive legally or illegally, typically they move to cities that have better economic prosperity.&nbsp; The long-term solution is for those nations to reduce their bad conditions by adopting higher levels of democracy.&nbsp; But that change won't occur quickly.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Election-system reform</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>Adopting ranked choice ballots for city elections, which begins in Portland next year, will yield higher levels of economic prosperity, beyond the gains from the makerbiz tax credit.&nbsp; This increased prosperity will attract yet more people from outside of Oregon who are unemployed, underemployed, and homeless.&nbsp; The long-term solution is for other cities and states to adopt ranked choice ballots for their elections, so that they too benefit economically.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Post-war boom</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>Lots of people like the idea of getting back to the economic prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s and into the 1970s.&nbsp; This popularity is reflected in the slogans of winning presidential candidates.&nbsp; Specifically lots of voters believed the word &ldquo;change&rdquo; in Obama's slogan &ldquo;hope and change,&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;great again&rdquo; in Trump's MAGA slogan, referred to going back to that high level of prosperity.</p>
<p>What gets overlooked is that those days of high prosperity happened because everyone in other nations needed to buy manufactured products from North America until their own nation built new factories to replace the ones that were bombed during World War Two.</p>
<p>That experience should have revealed the importance of factories as maker businesses that attracted huge amounts of money and valuable objects into North America.&nbsp; This prosperity flowed to factory workers as wages that were high enough to pay the mortgage on a house.&nbsp; This prosperity eliminated homelessness for people willing to work.</p>
<p>Another lesson from that historic time is that crime was low enough, and police officers were paid well enough, that &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; was easier to maintain compared to current times.</p>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">High-tech boom</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>Oregon's economic prosperity was boosted when computer-technology businesses grew in Silicon Valley and Seattle during the end of the 1900s.&nbsp; Many high-tech businesses, especially Intel, grew in Oregon to avoid the higher costs in California and Seattle, and because those &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses were given tax breaks.</p>
<p>That prosperity has declined now that maker businesses in other nations also make high-tech hardware and software products and services.</p>

        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>The arrival of software technology has shifted many maker businesses from relying on the US patent system to relying on the US copyright system.&nbsp; This shift away from factories also accounts for why small software-based maker businesses have been overlooked as engines of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Notice that state borders are not like national borders ....</p>



<p>Why else is this &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax-break path to economic prosperity so easily overlooked?&nbsp; Politicians tend to focus on the business owners who give them the biggest campaign contributions.&nbsp; Of course these biggest campaign contributors happen to be the ones whose income is most strongly affected by laws and taxes.</p>

<p>Small maker businesses don't have enough time or money to get special attention from politicians.&nbsp; And, unlike taker businesses, maker businesses earn money in ways that do not require gaining special advantages through special laws.&nbsp; So the owners of maker businesses have not spent much time or money pushing politicians for those special laws.</p>

<p>To better appreciate why small maker businesses are overlooked as an important economic engine, look at which kinds of organizations are represented in the Portland economic task force.&nbsp; Only two small maker businesses are represented.</p>

<p>It's time for the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature to recognize the wisdom of nurturing small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses with a &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.&nbsp; Especially it's time to stop short-sightedly exploiting them with the same high business tax rates that are easily affordable for law firms, financial institutions, and many other non-maker businesses.&nbsp; The increased money that small maker businesses will bring into Portland will quickly flow to those other kinds of businesses.</p>

<p>There's yet another advantage of the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.&nbsp; It will help some women entrepreneurs, and minority entrepreneurs, to grow their small maker business without the cost of administering yet another taxpayer&#8209;funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here's a link to a webpage that explains the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit in more detail, along with two other overdue economic reforms:</p>

<h2 class="text_center"><a href="votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb">votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb</a></h2>

<p>Instead of chasing away small maker businesses, both Portland and Oregon should give them lower effective tax rates to keep them here.&nbsp; Plus the lower taxes may attract yet more maker businesses from other states.&nbsp; Economic prosperity for Portland will follow.&nbsp; In turn, the economic prosperity will decrease unemployment, homelessness, drug abuse, and crime, which are symptoms of the underlying economic suffering now going on in Portland.</p>


<!--

<p>Already some small maker businesses have been leaving Portland to escape our relatively high business tax rates.&nbsp; And yet more of them are considering leaving.&nbsp; And many of the ones that remain in Portland are struggling financially.</p>


<p>When a maker business struggles, or fails, or leaves Oregon, there is a loss of tax revenue.&nbsp; When governmental agencies have less money, problems such as crime, drug abuse, and mental illness become harder to solve.</p>

<p>Even worse, the burden of high business taxes makes it harder for a business to grow.&nbsp; Yet growth of any business involves adding customers, adding employees, and paying more Oregon payroll taxes.</p>

<p>To help small maker businesses stay, and grow, both the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature should be giving them a tax break.</p>
