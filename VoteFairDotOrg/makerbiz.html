<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>


<p>It's easy to overlook the fact that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses bring large amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the relatively high business tax rates for small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses in Portland make it difficult for these small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses to grow.&nbsp; Yet their growth would bring lots more money into Portand from outside of Portland.&nbsp; Consider that when a maker business grows, it sells to more customers around the world, and the business hires more employees, and these added employees become the customers of non-maker businesses.&nbsp; Plus there's an increase in tax revenues flowing into the city of Portland and the state of Oregon.</p>

<p>In contrast to small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses, the value of large &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses is obvious.&nbsp; That's why special tax breaks are given to maker businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI.&nbsp; These large businesses attract huge amounts of money into the Portland area from customers around the state and around the world.&nbsp; This money makes it easy for them to lobby the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature to arrange these special tax breaks.&nbsp; Understandably the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature fear any large maker business moving to another city in another state.</p>

<p>Why are &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses so important?&nbsp; If suddenly all of Oregon lost all its maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, Oregon's economy would collapse.&nbsp; All other kinds of businesses would have no customers.&nbsp; That's because virtually no money would be flowing into Oregon from outside of Oregon.&nbsp; Funding for government services, including police departments and public schools, would drop catastrophically.&nbsp; Crime would escalate dramatically.&nbsp; Our current levels of homelessness, crime, and drug abuse would be remembered fondly as a much better time.</p>

<p>In the same way that Oregon maker businesses powers our Oregon economy, Portland's maker businesses powers Portland's economy.&nbsp; And when more money becomes available, more jobs become available, fewer people are unemployed, fewer people are homeless, and fewer people enter the downward spiral that leads to drug abuse and criminal activity.</p>

<p>Small maker businesses should be getting tax breaks.&nbsp; To better appreciate why, look at the following diagram and notice that money flows to the non-maker businesses only after passing through maker businesses.</p>

<p>What qualifies a business as a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; business?&nbsp; The following list describes the characteristics of a maker business.&nbsp; To make the contrast clearer, the list also describes the characteristics of &ldquo;taker&nbsp; businesses, which waste money, brainpower, fuel, or physical labor.&nbsp; And the list describes the in-between &ldquo;other&rdquo; category.&nbsp; As you read these category descriptions, remember that money flows through the top &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses before reaching the businesses in the lower categories.&nbsp; The lowest category is governments and non-profit organizations, which only get money after it has passed through at least one of the other categories.</p>



<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #aaffaa;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Maker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>&ldquo;Maker&rdquo; businesses earn most of their income from customers who do not live near the business.&nbsp; They do that by making unique things of value that previously did not already exist.&nbsp; These unique things have extra value because they are not available from other businesses in other states.</p>
<p>Most maker businesses, such as Intel and Tripwire, make products and services and send them to customers in other states, and sometimes to customers in other nations.&nbsp; Other maker businesses, such as OMSI and single-location restaurants, create a unique experience that attracts the customer to the business location.</p>
<p>Not including taxes, all the money that flows into a maker business flows out to its employees, suppliers, and business owners.&nbsp; From there the money flows to other businesses, to taker businesses, and to individuals.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #ffffaa;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Other businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>Businesses that are between the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;taker&rdquo; extremes typically do not make anything that didn't already exist.&nbsp; If they do make something, that product or service would not have value to customers outside the state, or else similar businesses in other states sell something similar to Oregon customers.</p>
<p>As a result, these in-between businesses do not bring a net flow of money into Oregon from outside of Oregon.</p>
<p>This category includes teaching, maintenance, healthcare, transportation, communication, retail, and sales.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Taker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>Taker businesses mostly transfer ownership of what already exists.&nbsp; If they do make something, what they make would not be of value outside Oregon, or else similar products and services are available in nearly every other state within the United States.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses drain or waste resources such as money, brainpower, and physical labor.&nbsp; Some taker businesses remove money from the local economy and send that money to their headquarters.&nbsp; And some taker businesses export natural resources to customers outside the state, which leaves less resources for future generations.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses give lots of money to political candidates because the decisions made by elected officials strongly affect how much these businesses earn.&nbsp; Often this regulation is needed because it would be easy for some taker businesses to defraud its customers, such as by running a financial business like a ponzi scheme.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #aaaaff;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Government entities and non-profit organizations</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>City and state governments get all their tax revenue from businesses, employees of businesses, investors who earn profits, and landowners who pay property taxes.&nbsp; Nearly all of this money first passes through maker businesses.</p>
<p>Government agencies transfer lots of their tax revenue to non-profit organizations that attempt to solve problems such as crime, homelessness, and drug addiction.</p>
<p>When the economy is more prosperous there is less crime, homelessness, and drug addiction.&nbsp; That's because an unemployed person can more easily get a job that pays well enough to rent a room in a shared house.&nbsp; Otherwise some unemployed people are motivated to steal, and to distract from their suffering through drug abuse.</p>
        </td></tr>

<p>It's time to recognize the wisdom of nurturing small maker businesses, and ending the practice of exploiting them with the same high tax rates that other kinds of businesses pay.&nbsp; Lower tax rates will make it easier for these businesses to grow into bigger maker businesses by selling to more customers and hiring more employees.&nbsp; This growth further increases the flow of money into Oregon.</p>

<p>When a small maker business hires more employees, these added employees spend money buying what other businesses sell.&nbsp; And these added employees pay yet more in taxes.</p>

<p>In short, small maker businesses are overlooked for their potential as a source of yet money flowing into Portland, and into Oregon.&nbsp; Instead the high business tax rates in Portland have caused lots of small maker businesses to relocate to Hillsboro, Beaverton, and cities across the Columbia River where business taxes are lower.&nbsp; And the high business tax rates deter out-of-state maker businesses from moving into Portland.</p>

<p>Instead of chasing away maker businesses, Portland and Oregon should give them lower effective tax rates to keep them here, and attract yet more maker businesses from other states.</p>

<p>A simple way for the thousands of small maker businesses in Portland to get a tax break is to add a special &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.</p>

<p>Instead of arranging the makerbiz tax credit one business at a time, a small maker business will simply claim the tax credit on their business tax form.&nbsp; Qualification will be based on their NAISC code and, if needed, by looking at their public domain-specific website to verify they make and sell something that has value to customers outside the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; Initially the tax credit amount would be limited according to how much the business paid in taxes during the previous year, and this limit can increase as the economic benefits become more obvious.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, the makerbiz tax credit will help some women entrepreneurs, and minority entrepreneurs, to grow their small maker business without the cost of administering yet another taxpayer-funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To better appreciate why small maker businesses are overlooked as an important economic engine, look at which kinds of organizations are represented in the Portland economic task force.&nbsp; Only two small maker businesses are represented.</p>

<p>It's time for Portland to wake up and realize that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses could easily grow more quickly by nurturing them, instead of exploiting them with the same high taxes that are imposed on taker businesses such as law firms and financial institutions.&nbsp; The &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit is an easy way to nurture the extremely valuable, yet overlooked, category of small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses.</p>
