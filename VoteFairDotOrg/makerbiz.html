<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>

<p class="text_center font_size_author">Written by Richard Fobes</p>

<p class="text_center">The VoteFair guy,<br />author of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i><br />and <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i></p>

<p class="small_font text_center text_wide_margin">When you &ldquo;read&rdquo; this article the first time, just <span style="color:red;">skim</span> the paragraphs, and just <span style="color:red;">briefly</span> look at each list.&nbsp;  Later you can return to focus on any specific sections of interest.</p>



<p>It's easy to overlook the fact that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses bring large amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.</p>

<p>In contrast, the value of large &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses is obvious.&nbsp; That's why special tax breaks are given to large maker businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI.</p>

<p>Why are &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses so important?&nbsp; If suddenly all of Oregon lost all its maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, Oregon's economy would collapse.&nbsp; Money would stop flowing into Oregon from outside of Oregon.&nbsp; Oregon's other businesses would have no customers, and no money to pay their employees.&nbsp; City and state government agencies, including police departments, would have no funding.&nbsp; At that point our currently high levels of homelessness, crime, lawlessness, drug abuse, and mental illness would be remembered fondly as a much better time.</p>

<p>Wisely, tax breaks are given to large maker businesses so they won't move to another city or state.&nbsp; And so they can more easily grow, acquire more customers, and hire more employees.&nbsp; Yet foolishly, tax breaks for small maker businesses are overlooked.</p>

<p>It's time for politicians to fear the loss of small maker businesses as much as they fear the loss of a big maker business such as Nike or OMSI.&nbsp; More specifically, the Portland city council needs to realize that giving a tax break to small maker businesses will dramatically increase economic prosperity for Portland.&nbsp; And the Oregon state legislature needs to recognize that adopting this tax break at the state level will dramatically increase economic prosperity for both Portland and Oregon.</p>

<p>To better appreciate the importance of maker businesses, let's start by understanding that money flows to non&#8209;maker businesses only after first passing through maker businesses.&nbsp; The following diagram conveys this important concept.</p>


<h2 class="table_title">Map of money flow direction</h2>

<h2>Small maker</h2>
<p>Attract lots of money from outside Portland.&nbsp; Then this money flows to local employees, other local businesses, local business owners, and local business taxes.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;<i><b>ZGF Architects</b></i>, <i>Tripwire</i>, <i>Puppet Software</i>, <i>Weiden+Kennedy</i>, <i><b>Mother's Bistro</b></i>, <i>Le Pigeon</i>, <i>Seasons & Regions</i>, <i>Andina</i>, <i>Portland City Grill</i>, <i>Annie Bloom's Books</i>, etc.</p>
<p>These businesses should be getting a tax break to make it easier for them to sell more to more customers, hire more employees, and boost the local economy through the taxes they pay.</p>
        </td><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Large maker</h2>

<p>These businesses are rewarded with special tax breaks.&nbsp; That's because they so obviously boost the local economy.</p>

<p>In other words, maker businesses are the bottleneck for economic growth.</p>

<p>What qualifies a business as a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; business?&nbsp; The following list describes some key characteristics of a maker business.&nbsp; For contrast, the list also describes the opposite kind of business, a &ldquo;taker&rdquo; business, and two other organization categories.</p>



<h2 class="table_title">Maker versus non-maker business categories</h2>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <col width="35%">
    <col width="65%">
    <tbody>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Maker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #aaffaa;">
<p>&ldquo;Maker&rdquo; businesses earn most of their income from customers who do not live near the business.&nbsp; They do that by making unique things of value that previously did not already exist.&nbsp; These unique things have extra value because they are not available from other businesses in other states.</p>
<p>Most maker businesses, such as Intel and Tripwire, make products and services and send them to customers in other states, and sometimes to customers in other nations.&nbsp; Other maker businesses, such as OMSI and single&#8209;location restaurants, create a unique experience that attracts the customer to the business location.</p>
<p>Not including taxes, all the money that flows into a maker business flows out to its employees, suppliers, and business owners.&nbsp; From there the money flows to other businesses, including taker businesses, and to individuals.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #ffffaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Other businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #ffffaa;">
<p>Businesses that are between the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;taker&rdquo; extremes typically do not make anything that didn't already exist.&nbsp; If they do make something, that product or service would not have value to customers outside the state, or else similar businesses in other states sell something similar to Oregon customers.</p>
<p>As a result, these in&#8209;between businesses do not bring a net flow of money into Oregon from outside of Oregon.</p>
<p>This category includes teaching, maintenance, healthcare, transportation, communication, retail, and sales.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Taker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;">
<p>Taker businesses mostly transfer ownership of what already exists.&nbsp; If they do make something, what they make would not be of value outside Oregon, or else similar products and services are available in nearly every other state within the United States.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses drain or waste resources such as money, brainpower, and physical labor.&nbsp; Some taker businesses remove money from the local economy and send that money to their headquarters.&nbsp; And some taker businesses export natural resources to customers outside the state, which leaves less resources for future generations.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses give lots of money to political candidates because the decisions made by elected officials strongly affect how much these businesses earn.&nbsp; This influence easily can lead to corruption, so lots of laws have been written to regulate specific kinds of taker businesses.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Government entities and non&#8209;profit organizations</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>City and state governments get nearly all their tax revenue from businesses, employees, investors, and landowners who get their money only after it has passed through at least one maker business.</p>
<p>Governments pass along some of their tax revenues to non&#8209;profit organizations that attempt to solve problems such as crime, homelessness, and drug addiction.</p>
        </td></tr>

<p>Maker businesses are easy to identify.&nbsp; The NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code number written on the company's IRS tax form clearly identifies some businesses as &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses.&nbsp; The number also identifies some other businesses as non-maker businesses.</p>

<p>Farms and ranches are the most basic kinds of maker businesses.&nbsp; Yet farms and ranches, both big and small, already get lots of tax breaks, and even have their own special IRS tax forms.</p>

<p>Factories are the next&#8209;most basic kind of maker business.&nbsp; Large manufacturing businesses already get tax breaks to reward them for employing more employees and paying lots of payroll taxes.</p>

<p>What will be the criteria for being a &ldquo;small&rdquo; maker business?&nbsp; The company's employee count easily measures the size of the business.&nbsp; The tax break will smoothly decrease as the number of employees increases.&nbsp; For example a full tax break can decrease down to a zero tax break as the business grows from, say, 50 employees to 150 employees.</p>

<p>Additional business characteristics, such as the kind of product or service it makes, can be verified by looking at the company's website.&nbsp; If the business only uses a TikTok or Facebook page instead of a website, the business would not qualify for the tax break.</p>

<p>Probably the easiest kind of tax break to implement is a tax credit.&nbsp; Let's call it the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.</p>

<p>Claiming the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit must be easy.&nbsp; If the existing business tax form is well-designed, the tax credit would be entered on a generic line by specifying a special code number and the amount.&nbsp; The amount would be calculated on a separate worksheet using numbers that are already declared elsewhere on the standard business tax form.</p>

<p>Would this &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit really increase economic prosperity?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Would it decrease the unemployment rate and homelessness rate?&nbsp; That depends.&nbsp; If Oregon is the only state that adopts the makerbiz tax credit, it would temporarily have a low percentage of unemployed Oregonians and a low percentage of homeless Oregonians.&nbsp; However, these lower rates will attract unemployed and homeless people from other states until Oregon gets back to the same rates as other states.</p>

<p>This brings us to the fact that Oregon is a state, not a nation, so there are some limits that become important to consider.&nbsp; The following list explains some of these limitations.</p>



<h2 class="table_title">Outside limits to increased prosperity</h2>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<p class="cell_content_left">Climate</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>The relative warmth of the Pacific Ocean during winter gives the western parts of California, Washington, and Oregon less-harsh winters, which attracts homeless people from elsewhere in the United States.&nbsp; As Portland's economic prosperity increases, more homeless people will move to Portland to escape harsh winters.&nbsp; And to escape overcrowding of homeless camps and shelters in southern California.</p>
        </td></tr>

<p class="cell_content_left">Immigration</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>Many nations south of the United States have high levels of violent crime and lots of economic hardships.&nbsp; People living in those nations will continue to be attracted to better conditions in the United States.&nbsp; Whether they arrive legally or illegally, typically they move to cities that have better economic prosperity.&nbsp; The long-term solution is for those nations to reduce their bad conditions by adopting higher levels of democracy that use ranked choice ballots.&nbsp; But that change won't happen soon.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Working remotely</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>The increase in working remotely is more of a symptom than an underlying cause of reduced economic prosperity in downtown Portland.&nbsp; Insisting that more employees commute into downtown office buildings to improve the downtown economy is getting things backwards.&nbsp; It's more effective to focus on helping small downtown maker businesses, including single-location eating places, because they attract customers to their location.&nbsp; This wisdom is often conveyed as attracting with a carrot rather than threatening to hit with a stick.</p>

<p class="cell_content_left">Post-war prosperity</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>Lots of people want to get back to the economic prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s and into the 1970s.</p>
<p>What gets overlooked is that those post-war years of high prosperity happened because everyone in other nations needed to buy manufactured products from North America while their own nations built new factories to replace the ones that were bombed during World War Two.</p>
<p>That experience should have revealed the importance of factories as money magnets.</p>
<p>Also that prosperity demonstrated that high wages for factory workers eliminates homelessness for people willing to work.</p>
<p>Another lesson from that historic prosperity is that &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; was easier to maintain because there was less conflict because fewer people were living in desparate situations, and because the strong economy funded well-paid police officers.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Law and order</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>Unfortunately many people, including many police officers, have an unrealistic understanding of law and order based on the fictional &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; TV shows.&nbsp; Lots of people see them as credible sources of information because the TV shows are promoted as realistic, the cases are based on real cases, and lots of the details are correct.</p>
<p>However, unlike real life, those fictional stories show criminals who are usually white, the person arrested is almost always the guilty criminal, and district attorneys are rarely shown defending someone who is not guilty.</p>
<p>Apparently official police officer training needs to be improved.&nbsp; Attempting to teach police officers all the details they correctly learn from the TV shows is not practical.&nbsp; However, official police training at least needs to educate police officers about the aspects of the fictional shows that are not realistic, with special clarifications about racial bias and the role of district attorneys.</p>

<p class="cell_content_left">High-tech prosperity</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>Oregon's economic prosperity was boosted during the end of the 1900s when computer-technology businesses in Silicon Valley and Seattle quickly grew, and spilled over into the Portland area.&nbsp; Much of that growth happened in Beaverton and Hillsboro because of the high business tax rates, and high costs of land, within the city of Portland.&nbsp; Remember that these large &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses were given tax breaks that small maker businesses don't yet get.</p>
<p>That prosperity within Oregon has declined now that maker businesses in other nations also make high-tech hardware and software products and services.</p>

<p class="cell_content_left">Patent system</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>The US patent system is biased in against small businesses.&nbsp; Specifically it's very expensive to hire a patent attorney to deal with the complications of getting a patent.&nbsp; It's even more expensive to hire a patent attorney to defend a patent, even if the larger business is clearly infringing on the patent.&nbsp; That's because the infringing business can counter-sue in ways that will bankrupt the small-business patent holder.</p>

<p class="cell_content_left">Software</p>
        </td><td class="cell_right" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p>The arrival of software technology has shifted many maker businesses from relying on the US patent system to relying on the US copyright system.&nbsp; This shift away from factories also accounts for why small software-based maker businesses have been overlooked as engines of economic prosperity.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_left" style="background-color: #88bbff;">
<p class="cell_content_left">Election-system reform</p>

<p>Adopting ranked choice ballots for city elections, which begins in Portland next year, will yield higher levels of economic prosperity, beyond the gains from the makerbiz tax credit.&nbsp; This increased prosperity will attract yet more people from outside of Oregon who are unemployed, underemployed, and homeless.&nbsp; The long-term solution is for other cities and states to adopt ranked choice ballots for their elections, so that they too benefit economically.</p>

<p>Some Republicans gave money to Barack Obama to block Hillary Clinton from reaching the general election.&nbsp; Those Republicans expected Obama to lose the general election.&nbsp; When he won instead, many Republicans regarded that election as evidence of an unfair election process.</p>
<p>Also those Republicans failed to understand that racial bias had been declining, and that Obama's slogan of &ldquo;hope and change&rdquo; was interpreted to mean he was going to implement long-overdue reforms.&nbsp; That was a strong contrast to John McCain's basic message being &ldquo;things are mostly fine as they are now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also Republican insiders failed to realize that not any high-ranking female Republican politician would be sufficiently popular as their vice presidential candidate.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Republican primary election, there were 17 candidates.&nbsp; The majority of Republican voters who opposed Donald Trump split their votes among 16 other candidates.&nbsp; Most voters believe that the candidate with the most first-choice votes is the most popular, without remembering that only works if the candidate with the most votes also gets more than half the votes.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;great again&rdquo; in Trump's slogan were interpreted to mean Trump was going to adopt reforms that would yield economic prosperity that was similar to the post-war years of prosperity.&nbsp; In contrast, Clinton's virtual slogan was &ldquo;I'm experienced, trust me&rdquo;, which implied she was not going to impliment any significant reforms.</p>
<p>A majority of voters voted for Clinton rather than Trump, so many cities had peaceful protests against Trump getting elected.&nbsp; Portland's peaceful protests continued longer than in many other cities.&nbsp; Political strategists wanted the embarrassment of our protests to end, so they recruited pro-Trump fans from other states to relocate to Vancouver, across the river from Portland, and those pro-Trump fans were shuttled to downtown Portland as counter-protesters.&nbsp; Those recruited pro-Trump fans sometimes used violence to intimidate the previously peaceful anti-Trump protestors.&nbsp; Soon the formerly peaceful protests transitioned into increasingly violent demonstrations, which attracted arsonists and looters.</p>
<p>The origins of the downtown violence, looting, and property damage get overlooked.&nbsp; Especially in the news reports to other cities.&nbsp; The result has been a narrative shift.&nbsp; Shifting the narrative back to what really happended would be helpful, especially when negotiating with police officers who mistakenly think that the demonstrations were about racial bias, or even about gender bias since the losing candidate was a woman.&nbsp; Especially important is to clarify that the racial component was a carryover from the 2008 election, not the 2016 election where both candidates were white.</p>
<p>If ranked choice ballots had been used in the 2016 presidential election, and if there was a well-designed interstate compact that overcomes the flaws of the electoral college votes, the ballot would have included a second Democrat and a second Republican.&nbsp; The most popular candidate would have won because ranked choice ballots provide the information that is now missing from our single-choice ballots.&nbsp; Probably the winner would have been either the second Republican or the second Democrat.&nbsp; This is a reminder that most voters typically do not like the nominees from either the Republican or Democratic parties.</p>
<p>The fact that Portland will be using ranked choice ballots in our 2024 election is a huge leap forward in beginning to unravel the very primitive vote-counting system we currently use.&nbsp; It is the source of lots and lots of problems that have led us to lower and lower levels of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>The earlier belief that the 2008 election was not fair led many Trump fans to attack Congress in a violent attempt to overturn the 2020 election result.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If ranked choice ballots had been used in the 2020 election, probably the ballot would have listed Elizabeth Warren as the second Democratic nominee, and Bernie Sanders as an independent candidate, and there would have been a second Republican candidate.&nbsp; We don't know who would have won because opinion polls do not use ranked choice ballots.&nbsp; Yet it's likely that neither Biden nor Trump would have won.</p>
<p>Here again is a reminder that our primitive election system is the source of lots and lots of problems that have led us to lower and lower levels of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>The 2024 general election will include a candidate from a new political party named the &ldquo;No Labels&rdquo; party.&nbsp; Several billionares who prefer Republican politicians are giving money to this party, and the spouse of the party's leader has a profession of helping Republican candidates get elected.</p>
<p>Based on currently discussed candidate choices, the No Labels candidate is likely to be more liberal than conservative.&nbsp; The effect will be to split votes away from the Democratic candidate, who is expected to be Joe Biden.&nbsp; This vote splitting will strongly increase the likelihood of the Republican nominee winning, regardless of who that nominee turns out to be.</p>
<p>If somehow ranked choice ballots were quickly adopted for use in the upcoming presidential election, there would be a second Democratic candidate and a second Republican candidate.&nbsp; And one of these second nominees would probably win.&nbsp; Once again the pattern is clear.&nbsp; Voters do not like the single nominee from either political party.</p>
<p>If this vote splitting tactic is successful, many people in many cities around the United States are likely to demonstrate against the unfair election result.&nbsp; If police officer training is not improved, and if political strategists again choose Portland as a target for importing counter-demonstrators from other states, another decline in economic prosperity for downtown Portland is likely.</p>

<p>Notice that it's important to understand the underlying reasons for current conditions.&nbsp; This understanding helps you recognize the difference between a symptom of a problem and the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>The best place to solve a problem is at the root of the problem.&nbsp; Simplistically insisting on changes that are focused on the symptoms does not solve the underlying problem.</p>

<p>The underlying problem with downtown Portland is a decrease in good-paying meaningful jobs in maker businesses.</p>

<p>Non-maker businesses tend to pay lower wages compared to maker businesses.&nbsp; That's because maker businesses sell things that are valued by many distant customers.&nbsp; For example people buy insurance from The Standard because they have to have insurance to reduce risk, but they aren't excited to buy insurance.&nbsp; In contrast, the Apple store in downtown Portland attracts long lines of customers because Apple makes things that are valued by people around the world.&nbsp; The result is a greater flow of money to maker businesses such as Apple.</p>

<p>Currently Oregon has relatively few maker businesses compared to California and Washington.&nbsp; Nike and Columbia Sportswear are the exceptions that highlight this weakness.&nbsp; Intel and Adidas have business locations in Oregon, but their headquarters are elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now imagine a small business that designs and outsource-manufactures a kitchen appliance that peels and chops potatoes, carrots, and onions.&nbsp; If the headquarters of that business were in downtown Portland, lots of money would flow into downtown Portland, and their office workers would be more motivated to commute to work downtown, compared to workers who process insurance claims.</p>

<p>The limitations of the patent system make it nearly impossible for such a business to exist, even though the technology to make such a kitchen appliance already exists.&nbsp; Specifically large businesses would take advantage of legal, yet somewhat unethical, patent tactics to force the business into being sold for cheap to a large business.</p>

<p>Yet this example of a kitchen-appliance business illustrates the point that maker businesses attract lots of money, and hire lots of well-paid employees, and that is what's needed to strengthen either Portland's economy or Oregon's economy.</p>

<p>Hopefully you now recognize the makerbiz tax credit will dramatically increase economic prosperity for any state that adopts this reform.</p>

<p>Why is this &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax-break path to economic prosperity so easily overlooked?&nbsp; Politicians tend to focus on the business owners who give them the biggest campaign contributions.&nbsp; These biggest campaign contributions come from owners of businesses that are significantly affected by laws and taxes.</p>

<p>In contrast, small maker businesses just need a free market and a fair market.&nbsp; They don't need to gain special advantages through special laws.&nbsp; So the owners of maker businesses don't spend much time or money lobbying politicians.&nbsp; So the voices of small maker businesses tend to be ignored.</p>

<p>This bias shows up in the Portland economic task force.&nbsp; As shown in the following list, only two small maker businesses are represented in the task force.&nbsp; Please pay attention to what they say.&nbsp; Also please pay attention to what uninvited leaders of other maker businesses say.&nbsp; That's because they are heavily outnumbered by representatives of other kinds of organizations that do not bring money into Portland from distant customers.</p>

<p>It's time for the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature to recognize the wisdom of nurturing small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses with a &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.</p>

<p>Especially it's time to stop short-sightedly exploiting them with the same high business tax rates that are easily affordable for law firms, financial institutions, and many other non-maker businesses.&nbsp; The increased money that small maker businesses will bring into Portland will quickly flow to those other kinds of businesses, and then into increased business taxes.&nbsp; And that inflow of money will hire more employees who get taxes deducted from their paychecks.&nbsp; And that increase in taxes will increase funding for city and state services that currently have inadequate funding.</p>

<p>As yet another advantage of the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit, women entrepreneurs and minority entrepreneurs who build maker businesses will get financial assistance to help their maker business grow more quickly.&nbsp; And that financial assistance will not require creating or funding yet another taxpayer&#8209;funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here's a link to a webpage that explains the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit in more detail, along with two other overdue economic reforms:</p>


<h2 class="table_title text_center background_color_for_link"><a href="http://votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb">votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb</a></h2>


<p>Instead of chasing away small maker businesses, both Portland and Oregon should give them lower effective tax rates to keep them here.&nbsp; Plus the lower taxes will attract yet more maker businesses from other states.&nbsp; Economic prosperity for Portland will follow.&nbsp; In turn, the economic prosperity will decrease unemployment, homelessness, drug abuse, and crime, which are symptoms of the underlying economic suffering now going on in Portland.</p>

archived paragraphs, delete later:

<p>Already some small maker businesses have been leaving Portland to escape our relatively high business tax rates.&nbsp; And yet more of them are considering leaving.&nbsp; And many of the ones that remain in Portland are struggling financially.</p>

<p>When a maker business struggles, or fails, or leaves Oregon, there is a loss of tax revenue.&nbsp; When governmental agencies have less money, problems such as crime, drug abuse, and mental illness become harder to solve.</p>

<p>Even worse, the burden of high business taxes makes it harder for a business to grow.&nbsp; Yet growth of any business involves adding customers, adding employees, and paying more Oregon payroll taxes.</p>

<p>To help small maker businesses stay, and grow, both the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature should be giving them a tax break.</p>
