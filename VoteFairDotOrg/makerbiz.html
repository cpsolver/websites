<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>


<p>It's easy to overlook the fact that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses bring large amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.</p>

<p>In contrast, the value of large &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses is obvious.&nbsp; That's why special tax breaks are given to large maker businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI.</p>

<p>Why are &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses so important?&nbsp; If suddenly all of Oregon lost all its maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, Oregon's economy would collapse.&nbsp; Money would stop flowing into Oregon from outside of Oregon, Oregon's other businesses would have no customers and no money to pay their employees.&nbsp; Tax revenues to government agencies, including police departments, would disappear.&nbsp; Massive levels of homelessness, lawlessness, and crime would follow.&nbsp; Our current levels of homelessness, crime, and drug abuse would be remembered fondly as a much better time.</p>

<p>Wisely, tax breaks are given to large maker businesses so they won't move to another city or state.&nbsp; Yet foolishly, tax breaks for small maker businesses are overlooked.</p>

<p>Already some small maker businesses have been leaving Portland to escape the rising business tax rates.&nbsp; And the ones that remain in Portland struggle financially.</p>

<p>Portland's relatively high business tax rates make it difficult for small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses to grow.&nbsp; Yet each new customer of a maker business adds to the money flowing into Portand from outside of Portland.&nbsp; That growth brings with it the need to hire more employees.&nbsp; Each additional employee increases tax revenues through payroll taxes.&nbsp; And governmental problems become easier to solve when more tax money becomes available.</p>

<p>It's time for politicians to fear the loss of small maker businesses as much as they fear the loss of a big maker business such as Nike or OMSI.&nbsp; Consider that collectively, small maker businesses probably attract as much money into Oregon as some of Oregon's larger businesses.&nbsp; 

<p>To help small maker businesses grow, both the Portland government and the Oregon government should be giving them a tax break.&nbsp; To clearly see this need, look at the following diagram.&nbsp; It clarifies that money flows to the non&#8209;maker businesses only after passing through maker businesses.&nbsp; Yet in spite of this importance, small maker businesses are not being rewarded the way large maker businesses are rewarded.</p>

<p>What qualifies a business as a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; business?&nbsp; The following list describes key characteristics of a maker business, and its opposite, which is a &ldquo;taker&rdquo; business.&nbsp; The list also describes the in&#8209;between &ldquo;other&rdquo; category, and the remaining category of governments and non&#8209;profit organizations.</p>

<p>As you read these category descriptions, remember that money flows through the top &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses before reaching the businesses in the lower categories.&nbsp; And remember that governments only get money after it has passed through at least one business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maker&rdquo; businesses earn most of their income from customers who do not live near the business.&nbsp; They do that by making unique things of value that previously did not already exist.&nbsp; These unique things have extra value because they are not available from other businesses in other states.</p>
<p>Most maker businesses, such as Intel and Tripwire, make products and services and send them to customers in other states, and sometimes to customers in other nations.&nbsp; Other maker businesses, such as OMSI and single&#8209;location restaurants, create a unique experience that attracts the customer to the business location.</p>
<p>Not including taxes, all the money that flows into a maker business flows out to its employees, suppliers, and business owners.&nbsp; From there the money flows to other businesses, to taker businesses, and to individuals.</p>

<p>Businesses that are between the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;taker&rdquo; extremes typically do not make anything that didn't already exist.&nbsp; If they do make something, that product or service would not have value to customers outside the state, or else similar businesses in other states sell something similar to Oregon customers.</p>
<p>As a result, these in&#8209;between businesses do not bring a net flow of money into Oregon from outside of Oregon.</p>
<p>This category includes teaching, maintenance, healthcare, transportation, communication, retail, and sales.</p>

<p>Taker businesses mostly transfer ownership of what already exists.&nbsp; If they do make something, what they make would not be of value outside Oregon, or else similar products and services are available in nearly every other state within the United States.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses drain or waste resources such as money, brainpower, and physical labor.&nbsp; Some taker businesses remove money from the local economy and send that money to their headquarters.&nbsp; And some taker businesses export natural resources to customers outside the state, which leaves less resources for future generations.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses give lots of money to political candidates because the decisions made by elected officials strongly affect how much these businesses earn.&nbsp; Often this regulation is needed because it would be easy for some taker businesses to defraud its customers, such as by running a financial business as a ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>In other words, maker businesses are the bottleneck for economic growth.</p>

<p>Factories are the most basic kind of maker business.&nbsp; During the 1950s and 1960s factories and factory jobs provided a high level of economic prosperity.&nbsp; At that time unemployment was very low, homelessness was rare, and police officers were able to maintain &ldquo;law and order.&rdquo; That experience revealed the importance of maker businesses.</p>

<p>Alas, for North Americans, those decades of prosperity began to end when other industrial nations built factories that replaced the ones they lost during world war two.&nbsp; Yet any state, including Oregon, can regain that deep-rooted kind of economic prosperity by nurturing the businesses that make things that sell to customers around the world.</p>

<p>Instead of reducing taxes on just the biggest maker businesses, it's time to recognize the need to also reduce taxes on small maker businesses.</p>

<p>Why is this path to economic prosperity being overlooked?&nbsp; Politicians tend to focus on the business owners who give them the biggest campaign contributions, which happen to be the ones whose income is most strongly affected by laws and taxes.&nbsp; Small maker businesses don't have enough time or money to get the attention of politicians.&nbsp; And, unlike taker businesses, maker businesses earn money in ways that do not require special laws that give them special advantages.</p>

<p>To better appreciate why small maker businesses are overlooked as an important economic engine, look at which kinds of organizations are represented in the Portland economic task force.&nbsp; Only two small maker businesses are represented.</p>

<p>It's time to recognize the wisdom of nurturing small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses, instead of short-sightedly exploiting them.&nbsp; The money they bring into Portland quickly flows to other businesses such as law firms and financial institutions, which can easily afford Portland's high tax rate.</p>

<p>Let's adopt the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit as an easy way to nurture the extremely valuable, yet overlooked, category of small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses.</p>


<p>Here's a link to a webpage that explains the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit in more detail, along with two other overdue economic reforms:</p>

<h2 class="text_center"><a href="votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb">votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb</a></h2>


<!--

 These benefits reduce unemployment, reduce homelessness, and reduce the number of people who enter the downward spiral that leads to drug abuse and criminal activity.

<p>It's time to recognize the wisdom of nurturing small maker businesses, and ending the practice of exploiting them with the same high tax rates that other kinds of businesses pay.&nbsp; Lower tax rates will make it easier for these businesses to grow into bigger maker businesses by selling to more customers and hiring more employees.&nbsp; This growth further increases the flow of money into Oregon.</p>

<p>When a small maker business hires more employees, these added employees spend money buying what other businesses sell.&nbsp; And these added employees pay yet more in taxes.</p>

<p>In short, small maker businesses are overlooked for their potential as a source of yet money flowing into Portland, and into Oregon.&nbsp; Instead the high business tax rates in Portland have caused lots of small maker businesses to relocate to Hillsboro, Beaverton, and cities across the Columbia River where business taxes are lower.&nbsp; And the high business tax rates deter out&#8209;of&#8209;state maker businesses from moving into Portland.</p>

<p>Instead of chasing away maker businesses, both Portland and Oregon should give them lower effective tax rates to keep them here, and attract yet more maker businesses from other states.</p>

<p>A simple way for the thousands of small maker businesses in Portland to get a tax break is to add a special &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.</p>

<p>Instead of arranging the makerbiz tax credit one business at a time, a small maker business will simply claim the tax credit on their business tax form.&nbsp; Qualification will be based on their NAISC code and, if needed, by looking at their public domain&#8209;specific website to verify they make and sell something that has value to customers outside the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; Initially the tax credit amount can be limited according to how much the business paid in taxes during the previous year, and this limit can increase as the economic benefits become more obvious.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, the makerbiz tax credit will help some women entrepreneurs, and minority entrepreneurs, to grow their small maker business without the cost of administering yet another taxpayer&#8209;funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>


 not just the big ones, to grow to become prosperous.&nbsp; This approach empowers people to enter the upward spiral that leads to employment, individual prosperity, the desire to protect wealth instead of steal, the appreciation of police activity instead of regarding police officers as the enemy, the desire to avoid drugs and other distractions from feelings of happiness.&nbsp; All of this follows by increasing prosperity rather than short-sightedly exploiting it.</p>

the most efficient way to reduce crime, homelessness, and drug addiction is to prevent people from entering the downward spiral that leads to drug abuse and criminal activity.&nbsp; The best way to prevent the downward spiral is to increase employment.&nbsp; The most efficient way to increase employment is to 


 is remembered fondly because everyone who wanted a factory job could get a job that paid well enough to buy a house.
