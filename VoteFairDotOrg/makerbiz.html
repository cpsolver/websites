<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>


<p>It's easy to overlook the fact that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses bring large amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.</p>

<p>In contrast, the value of large &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses is obvious.&nbsp; That's why special tax breaks are given to large maker businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI.</p>

<p>Why are &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses so important?&nbsp; If suddenly all of Oregon lost all its maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, Oregon's economy would collapse.&nbsp; Money would stop flowing into Oregon from outside of Oregon.&nbsp; Oregon's other businesses would have no customers, and no money to pay their employees.&nbsp; City and state government agencies, including police departments, would have no funding.&nbsp; At that point our current levels of homelessness, crime, lawlessness, drug abuse, and mental illness would be remembered fondly as a much better time.</p>

<p>Wisely, tax breaks are given to large maker businesses so they won't move to another city or state.&nbsp; Yet foolishly, tax breaks for small maker businesses are overlooked.</p>

<p>Already some small maker businesses have been leaving Portland to escape the rising business tax rates.&nbsp; And the ones that remain in Portland struggle financially.</p>

<p>Portland's non-discounted tax rates make it difficult for small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses to grow.&nbsp; Yet each new customer of a maker business adds to the money flowing into Portand from outside of Portland.&nbsp; That economic growth leads to hiring more employees.&nbsp; Each additional employee increases tax revenues through payroll taxes.&nbsp; And governmental problems become easier to solve when more tax money becomes available.</p>

<p>It's time for politicians to fear the loss of small maker businesses as much as they fear the loss of a big maker business such as Nike or OMSI.&nbsp; They need to be reminded that small maker businesses collectively attract as much money into Oregon as one of Oregon's larger businesses.&nbsp; Yet they are not being rewarded the way large maker businesses are rewarded.</p>

<p>To help small maker businesses stay, and grow, both the Portland city council and the Oregon state legislature should be giving them a tax break.</p>

<p>To further understand why, look at the following diagram.&nbsp; It clarifies that money flows to non&#8209;maker businesses only after passing through maker businesses.</p>


<h2 class="table_title">Business types</h2>

<table class="table_2_by_2" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<h2>Small maker</h2>
<p>Attract lots of money from outside Portland.&nbsp; Yet they pay the same high business tax rates as non&#8209;maker businesses, which do not attract much money from outside Portland.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;ZGF Architects, Tripwire, Mother's Bistro, Le Pigeon, Seasons & Regions, Andina, Portland City Grill, Annie Bloom's Books, etc.</p></p>
        </td><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Large maker</h2>
<p>Attract lots of money from outside Portland.&nbsp; They are rewarded with special tax breaks.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, OMSI, etc.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top"><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Small non&#8209;maker</h2>
<p>Most of their income arrives after first passing through maker businesses.&nbsp; They lose customers when maker businesses fail or move out of Portland.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp;Dental offices, retail stores, law firms, franchise locations, etc.</p>
        </td><td class="cell_2_by_2">
<h2>Large non&#8209;maker</h2>
<p>Most of their income arrives after first passing through maker businesses.&nbsp; They lose customers when maker businesses fail or move out of Portland.</p>

<p>What qualifies a business as a &ldquo;maker&rdquo; business?&nbsp; The following list describes key characteristics of a maker business, and its opposite, which is a &ldquo;taker&rdquo; business.&nbsp; The list also describes the in&#8209;between &ldquo;other&rdquo; category, and the remaining category of governments and non&#8209;profit organizations.</p>

<p>As you read these category descriptions, remember that money flows through the top &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses before reaching the businesses in the lower categories.&nbsp; And remember that tax revenues arrive only after the money has passed through at least one business.</p>

<p class="cell_content_left">Maker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>&ldquo;Maker&rdquo; businesses earn most of their income from customers who do not live near the business.&nbsp; They do that by making unique things of value that previously did not already exist.&nbsp; These unique things have extra value because they are not available from other businesses in other states.</p>
<p>Most maker businesses, such as Intel and Tripwire, make products and services and send them to customers in other states, and sometimes to customers in other nations.&nbsp; Other maker businesses, such as OMSI and single&#8209;location restaurants, create a unique experience that attracts the customer to the business location.</p>
<p>Not including taxes, all the money that flows into a maker business flows out to its employees, suppliers, and business owners.&nbsp; From there the money flows to other businesses, to taker businesses, and to individuals.</p>

        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>Businesses that are between the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;taker&rdquo; extremes typically do not make anything that didn't already exist.&nbsp; If they do make something, that product or service would not have value to customers outside the state, or else similar businesses in other states sell something similar to Oregon customers.</p>
<p>As a result, these in&#8209;between businesses do not bring a net flow of money into Oregon from outside of Oregon.</p>
<p>This category includes teaching, maintenance, healthcare, transportation, communication, retail, and sales.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Taker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>Taker businesses mostly transfer ownership of what already exists.&nbsp; If they do make something, what they make would not be of value outside Oregon, or else similar products and services are available in nearly every other state within the United States.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses drain or waste resources such as money, brainpower, and physical labor.&nbsp; Some taker businesses remove money from the local economy and send that money to their headquarters.&nbsp; And some taker businesses export natural resources to customers outside the state, which leaves less resources for future generations.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses give lots of money to political candidates because the decisions made by elected officials strongly affect how much these businesses earn.&nbsp; Often this regulation is needed because it would be easy for some taker businesses to defraud its customers, such as by running a financial business as a ponzi scheme.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #aaaaff;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Government entities and non&#8209;profit organizations</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>City and state governments get nearly all their tax revenue from businesses, employees, investors, and landowners who get their money only after it has passed through at least one maker business.</p>
<p>Governments pass along some of their tax revenues to non&#8209;profit organizations that attempt to solve problems such as crime, homelessness, and drug addiction.</p>

<p>In other words, maker businesses are the bottleneck for economic growth.</p>

<p>Also notice that maker businesses are easy to identify.&nbsp; The NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code number they write on their IRS tax form, and their employee count, would determine whether the business qualifies for the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.&nbsp; In some cases the website at their domain name might need to be checked to verify they sell a product or service or experience that has value to customers outside the Portland area.</p>

<p>Farms and ranches are the most basic kinds of maker businesses.&nbsp; Yet small farms and ranches would not qualify because they already get lots of industry-specific tax breaks.&nbsp; In fact, they get their own IRS tax forms.</p>

<p>Factories are the next&#8209;most basic kind of maker business.&nbsp; During the 1950s and 1960s factories and factory jobs provided a high level of economic prosperity for the United States and Canada.&nbsp; At that time unemployment was very low, homelessness was rare, and police officers were able to maintain &ldquo;law and order.&rdquo; That experience should have revealed the importance of maker businesses.&nbsp; Alas, for North Americans, those decades of prosperity began to end when other industrial nations built factories that replaced the ones they lost during world war two.</p>

<p>Computer-based and software-based businesses have become valuable maker businesses.&nbsp; Partly this is because the US patent system has become so heavily biased against small businesses.&nbsp; Fortunately copyright laws are much fairer, without bias against small businesses.&nbsp; This development also accounts for why small maker businesses have been overlooked as engines of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Why else is this path to economic prosperity so easily overlooked?&nbsp; Politicians tend to focus on the business owners who give them the biggest campaign contributions.&nbsp; Of course these biggest campaign contributors happen to be the ones whose income is most strongly affected by laws and taxes.</p>

<p>Small maker businesses don't have enough time or money to get special attention from politicians.&nbsp; And, unlike taker businesses, maker businesses earn money in ways that do not require gaining special advantages through special laws.</p>

<p>To better appreciate why small maker businesses are overlooked as an important economic engine, look at which kinds of organizations are represented in the Portland economic task force.&nbsp; Only two small maker businesses are represented.</p>

<p>It's time to recognize the wisdom of nurturing small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses, instead of short-sightedly exploiting them with high business tax rates.&nbsp; The money they bring into Portland quickly flows to other businesses such as law firms and financial institutions, and those kinds of businesses can easily afford Portland's high tax rate.</p>

<p>Here's a link to a webpage that explains the &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit in more detail, along with two other overdue economic reforms:</p>

<h2 class="text_center"><a href="votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb">votefair.org/taker_tactics.html#mb</a></h2>

<p>Instead of chasing away small maker businesses, both Portland and Oregon should give them lower effective tax rates to keep them here.&nbsp; Plus the lower taxes may attract yet more maker businesses from other states.</p>

<p>As a further bonus, the makerbiz tax credit will help some women entrepreneurs, and minority entrepreneurs, to grow their small maker business without the cost of administering yet another taxpayer&#8209;funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>
