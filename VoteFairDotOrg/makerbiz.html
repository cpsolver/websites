<h1 class="title">Makerbiz Tax Credit Will Strengthen Portland's Economy</h1>

<p>It's obvious that Portland-area &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses such as Columbia Sportswear, Ampere Computing, Laika, and OMSI bring lots of money into the Portland economy.&nbsp; So it's easy for them to arrange special tax breaks.</p>

<p>What gets overlooked is that small &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses also bring significant amounts of money into Portland from outside the city.&nbsp; These businesses include: small Portland manufacturers, some software-based businesses, single-location restaurants (Le Pigeon, Portland City Grill, and hundreds more), local publishers, local performance venues, and local self-employed artists and performers.</p>

<p>Why are &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses so important?&nbsp; If suddenly all of Oregon lost all its maker businesses, including Intel and Nike, Oregon's economy would collapse.&nbsp; All other kinds of businesses would have no customers.&nbsp; That's because virtually no money would be flowing into Oregon from outside of Oregon.&nbsp; Funding for government services, including police departments and public schools, would drop catastrophically.&nbsp; Crime would escalate dramatically.&nbsp; Our current levels of homelessness, crime, and drug abuse would be remembered fondly as a much better time.</p>

<p>The money earned by maker businesses is what powers our Oregon economy.&nbsp; To better appreciate how it flows to other businesses and to governments and to non-profit organizations, look at the following list.&nbsp; As you read about the different categories, consider that money flows from the top categories to the lower categories.</p>



<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <col width="35%">
    <col width="65%">
    <tbody>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #aaffaa;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Maker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>&ldquo;Maker&rdquo; businesses earn most of their income from customers who do not live near the business.&nbsp; They do that by making unique things of value that previously did not already exist.&nbsp; Those unique things have extra value because they are not available from other businesses in other states.</p>
<p>Most maker businesses make products or services, or both.&nbsp; Yet some maker businesses, such as museums and single-location restaurants, create a unique experience that attracts the customer to the business location.</p>
<p>The money that flows to a maker business then flows to its employees, suppliers, and business owners.&nbsp; From there, after taxes are paid to governments, the money flows to other businesses, to taker businesses, and to individuals.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #ffffaa;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Other businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>Businesses that are between the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; and &ldquo;taker&rdquo; extremes mostly sell products and services to local customers, they sell products and services that are similar to what's available in other states, and typically these businesses do not make anything that didn't already exist.&nbsp; As a result they do not bring much money into Oregon from outside of Oregon.</p>
<p>If these businesses sell to lots of customers outside the state, that inward flow of money is counter-balanced by other businesses in other states selling similar products and services to Oregon customers.</p>
<p>This category includes: retail, transportation, communication, ....</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #ffaaaa;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Taker businesses</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>Taker businesses mostly sell to Oregon customers, do not create things that would be of value outside Oregon, and typically sell things that also are available in nearly every other state within the United States.</p>
<p>Many taker businesses must be closely regulated to ensure that the business does not defraud its customers.&nbsp; For example, without such regulation the officers of a bank could exploit their access to money, run it like a ponzi scheme, and then declare bankruptcy.</p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr valign="top" style="background-color: #aaaaff;"><td class="cell_any cell_left">
<p class="cell_content_left">Government entities and non-profit organizations</p>
        </td><td class="cell_any cell_right">
<p>Government agencies give lots of taxpayer dollars to non-profit organizations that attempt to solve problems such as crime, homelessness, and drug addiction.</p>
<p>When the economy is more prosperous there is less crime, homelessness, and drug addiction.&nbsp; That's because an unemployed person can more easily get a job that pays well enough to rent a room in a shared house.&nbsp; Otherwise some unemployed people are motivated to steal, and to distract from their suffering through drug abuse.</p>

<p>It's time to recognize that small maker businesses are overlooked as a huge source of money flowing into Portland.&nbsp; But instead of directly exploiting that flow of money with high tax rates, those businesses should be nurtured to grow into bigger maker businesses.&nbsp; As it grows the business gains more customers that further increase the flow of money into Oregon.&nbsp; And the business hires yet more employees, and those added employees spend money buying what non-maker businesses sell.&nbsp; Plus those added employees pay yet more in taxes.</p>

<!--
<p>The makerbiz tax credit will slow down, and even reverse, the rate at which Portland maker businesses have been moving out of Portland to avoid Portland's high business tax rates, and to avoid Oregon's high business tax burden.</p>
-->

<p>Portland's and Oregon's high tax rates for maker businesses has motivated many small maker businesses to move out of Portland and out of Oregon, which enriches Hillsboro, Beaverton, and cities across the Columbia River.&nbsp; Instead of chasing away maker businesses, Portland and Oregon should give them lower effective tax rates to keep them here, and attract yet more maker businesses from other states.&nbsp; That's easy to arrange for big maker businesses, but small maker businesses don't yet have a simple way to get similar tax breaks.</p>

<p>A simple way for the thousands of small maker businesses in Portland to get a tax break is to add a special &ldquo;makerbiz&rdquo; tax credit.</p>

<p>Instead of arranging the makerbiz tax credit one business at a time, a small maker business will simply claim the tax credit on their business tax form.&nbsp; Qualification will be based on their NAISC code and, if needed, by looking at their public domain-specific website to verify they make and sell something that has value to customers outside the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; Initially the tax credit amount would be limited according to how much the business paid in taxes during the previous year, and this limit can increase as the economic benefits become more obvious.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, the makerbiz tax credit will help some women entrepreneurs, and minority entrepreneurs, to grow their small business without the cost of administering yet another taxpayer-funded &ldquo;assistance program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To better appreciate why small maker businesses are overlooked as an important economic engine, look at which kinds of organizations are represented in the Portland economic task force.&nbsp; Only two small maker businesses are represented.</p>
