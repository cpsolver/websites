<h1 class="title">Why&nbsp;A&nbsp;Better Vote&#8209;Counting&nbsp;System Will&nbsp;Yield Widespread&nbsp;Economic&nbsp;Prosperity</h1>

<p class="text_center font_size_author">Written by Richard Fobes</p>

<p class="text_center">Author of<br /><i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i><br />and<br /><i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i></p>

<p class="small_font text_center">Asterisks indicate that clarifications appear at the end of this webpage</p>


<p>The biggest fight in politics is between business owners and the majority of voters.<sup>*</sup>&nbsp; Surprisingly there are ways to benefit <i>both</i> business owners and the rest of us.&nbsp; These reforms will enable both business owners and the rest of us to soar to new heights of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Here's the key to understanding how prosperity can increase for business owners, and customers, and employees.&nbsp; Recognize that customers, employees, and shareholders can be, and often are, the same person.</p>

<p>Specifically, consider that when a pharmaceutical business uses unfair tactics that increase the cost of a medication the person uses, the person has less money to become the customer of a different business.&nbsp; And when the person's employer uses unfair tactics that reduce the person's wages, the person cannot afford to become a consumer of products from other businesses.&nbsp; And when the same person also has money in the stock market, and owns shares of yet another business, that partially owned business might be giving lots of campaign funds to politicians who pass laws that allow the business to extract extra money from the person's wallet.</p>

<p>In other words, we no longer live in a world where nobles and peasants are easy to identify.&nbsp; Instead we are all tightly interconnected.&nbsp; As a result, the world economy is dragged down each time a business extracts extra money from a customer, from a customer of a competing business, and from an employee.</p>

<p>In the following sections you will learn about, or be reminded of, money-extraction tactics, wage-extraction tactics, and tactics that block the kinds of businesses we need more of.&nbsp; Although these tactics are unethical, they are legal because state and federal laws have been written to support these unethical tactics.&nbsp; State legislatures and Congress approved these laws because our elected representatives get most of their biggest campaign contributions from the owners of the kinds of businesses that exploit these unethical business tactics.</p>

<p>The simple solution to this economy-draining feedback loop is to replace our primitive vote-counting system with a better vote-counting system that resists being exploited in ways that involve money.&nbsp; Then we, the majority of voters, will fully control both Republican and Democratic legislators and members of Congress.&nbsp; Then we will begin to bring an end to the unethical business tactics that extract money from our wallets as consumers and employees.&nbsp; That transformation will allow our interconnnected civilization to reach much higher levels of widespread economic prosperity.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Problem:&nbsp; Money extraction from customers</h2>

<p>To better understand how nearly everyone can get what they want, let's start by identifying the money-extraction tactics that specific kinds of businesses use to extract extra money from their customers.&nbsp; As you read about these tactics, remember the customers are us, the majority of voters.</p>

<p>If you are seeing this list for the first time, don't bother reading everything in this list.&nbsp; The important point is that a huge number of money-extraction tactics are used by a huge number of large and medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p>As you skim this list, keep in mind that each business category listed here competes for dollars from the same wallets as the other business categories.&nbsp;  Expressed another way, if you recognize that you financially benefit from one of these money-extraction tactics, consider that <i>&ldquo;your&rdquo;</i> business will sell more products and services when <i>other</i> business owners in this list have stopped using <i>their</i> tactics to remove money from <i>your</i> customers, and <i>your</i> future customers.</p>

<p>Considered one by one, most of these specific money-extraction tactics impose only a relatively small burden on the overall economy.&nbsp; However all these money-extraction tactics are used together by thousands of medium and large businesses.&nbsp; So overall, they drag down the entire economy by a huge amount.</p>

<p>From our perspective as voters, these money-extraction tactics yield higher consumer prices.&nbsp; That's exactly the opposite of what we want.&nbsp; We want lower consumer prices.</p>

<p>Lower consumer prices will allow us to buy more of what other businesses sell.&nbsp; In turn, that increased consumption will increase the gross domestic product (GDP), which is a flawed-yet-useful measure of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>As a further benefit, there will be fewer negative side effects.&nbsp; Remember that some of these money-extraction tactics lead to death, injury, disease, depression, and unhappiness.</p>

<p>Now let's look at how we, the majority of voters, can begin to defeat these money-extraction tactics.&nbsp; It involves increasing our control over who gets elected to state legislatures and Congress.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Solution:&nbsp; Election system reform</h2>

<p>To better understand how owners of businesses win the political fight against us, the majority of voters, let's look at the <i>election-manipulation</i> tactics that business owners use to control both the Republican and Democratic parties.&nbsp; Also let's look at how to defeat these election-manipulation tactics.</p>

<p>The most important part of the solution is to change our ballots.&nbsp; Our ballots need to ask for more than just our first choice.&nbsp; The ballot also needs to ask for our second choice, third choice, and so on, for as many candidates as we want to rank.&nbsp; This kind of ballot is called a &ldquo;ranked choice ballot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It's easy to count ranked choice ballots in a way that correctly identifies which candidate deserves to become a mayor, governor, or president.&nbsp; And it's easy for software to count ranked choice ballots in ways that fill state legislatures and Congress with the people who better represent most voters.</p>

<p>As you read about these election-manipulation tactics, keep in mind that during the primary election most of these business owners either directly or indirectly contribute money to candidates in both political parties. <sup>*</sup>&nbsp; This primary-election blocking tactic robs us, the majority of voters, from getting a reform-minded candidate from either party in the general election.</p>

<p>During a <i>primary</i> election, if any candidate in either party expresses support for a reform that would end a money-extraction tactic or wage-extraction tactic, that reform-minded candidate is blocked from reaching the general election.</p>
<p>This blocking tactic at least involves giving campaign contributions to a candidate in the same party who does not express support for the disliked reform.&nbsp; If the non-reform-minded candidate is not popular enough to win the party's nomination, additional money is given to a &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo; candidate who splits votes away from the reform-minded candidate, which makes it possible for the non-reform-minded candidate to win the party's nomination without majority support.</p>
<p>This blocking tactic exploits the current limit of each party nominating just one nominee.</p>
<p>Many business owners give campaign contributions to a political action committee (PAC) that may use this blocking tactic in both the Republican primary and the Democratic primary.</p>
<p>A clear example of this blocking tactic happened during the 2008 U.S. presidential Democratic <i>primary</i> election.&nbsp; Some business owners who wanted a Republican president gave money to Democratic candidate Barack Obama to block Hillary Clinton from reaching the general election. <sup>*</sup></p>
<p>A less obvious, yet more typical, example of this blocking tactic occurred in the 2004 U.S. presidential Democratic primary election.&nbsp; Money was given to John Kerry as a weaker Democratic candidate, and money was given to Howard Dean as a &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo; candidate, for the purpose of defeating then-popular Democratic candidate John Edwards.&nbsp; This nomination made it easier for Republican George W. Bush to win against Kerry in the general election. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>Functionally this is the same election-manipulation tactic as vote splitting in the general election.&nbsp; However it's less obvious during a primary election because the winner is always from the correct party.&nbsp; As a further barrier to recognition, opinion polls don't use ranked choice ballots, so the actual most popular candidate is unknown.</p>
<p>In the 2020 US Presidential election Joe Biden got the &ldquo;most votes,&rdquo; yet a majority of Democratic voters wanted a reform-minded candidate such as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.&nbsp; We don't know which candidate was actually most popular because ranked choice ballots were not used.</p>
<p>Vote splitting happened at the beginning of the 2016 Republican presidential <i>primary</i> election.&nbsp; The majority of Republican voters voted for someone other than Donald Trump, but they split their votes among the 16 other Republican candidates.&nbsp; The higher vote count for Trump compared to any single other candidate gave the impression he was the most popular candidate, which caused other candidates to drop out even though one of them might have been more popular. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>What gets confusing is how ranked-choice ballot marks should be counted. <sup>*</sup>&nbsp; Fortunately this confusion will disappear when better election software becomes available, and when better videos become available to explain how the counting is done.</p>

<p>The result of adopting wisely designed ranked choice ballots, and wisely designed election software, will be to <i>increase</i> the influence of voters, and <i>decrease</i> the effectiveness of the biggest campaign contributions.</p>

<p>Understandably many business owners are afraid of adopting ranked choice ballots.&nbsp; They know they will lose some of their control over politicians.&nbsp; Mistakenly they also fear they will suffer economically.&nbsp; After all, the goal behind the biggest campaign contributions is to stop politicians from adopting the reforms the majority of voters want.</p>

<p>Yet, as stated at the beginning of this webpage, most business owners will earn more money, not less money, when voters have more control over election outcomes.&nbsp; That's because elected representatives will bring an end to the unethical tactics that extract extra money from the wallets of consumers.&nbsp; With more money in their wallets, more customers will be able to afford more of what ethical businesses sell.</p>

<h2>Problem:&nbsp; Money extraction from employees</h2>

<p>Remember that the biggest fight in politics is between business owners and the majority of voters.&nbsp; The largest part of this fight is about wages.</p>

<p>Most business owners want to pay wages that are just high enough to prevent employees from leaving.&nbsp; Yet most employees, which includes a huge percentage of voters, want higher wages.</p>

<p>Here's a list of wage-extraction tactics that business owners use to reduce how much money they pay employees.&nbsp; As you skim this list, keep in mind that reduced wages drag down the overall economy because the employees are also customers, and potential customers, of other businesses.</p>

<p>Here's a way to better understand why these wage-suppression tactics bring down the overall economy.&nbsp; When employees working for one business have less money available to buy what other businesses sell, the <i>other</i> businesses earn less money, which limits how much <i>they</i> can pay <i>their</i> employees.&nbsp; It's a feedback loop.&nbsp; This feedback loop is bad when it spirals downward to increasingly lower levels of prosperity.&nbsp; That's what's happening now.&nbsp; Yet this same feedback loop also can spiral upward to higher levels of prosperity.&nbsp; That's what everyone wants. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>How can this better feedback loop be kick-started?</p>

<h2>Solution:&nbsp; &ldquo;Perbiz&rdquo; wage-gap tax break</h2>

<p>To understand how to defeat unfair wage-suppression tactics, let's start by remembering some important differences between lower-paid and higher-paid employees.&nbsp; The following table lists some of these important differences.</p>

<p>As you skim this table, notice that lower-paid employees tend to be under-appreciated for the work they do.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that a large percentage of women choose professions in which they help customers, clients, and patients.&nbsp; In contrast, a large percentage of men choose professions in which they manage money, or manage people, or manage both money and people.&nbsp; This difference accounts for a big part of the gender wage gap, in which women typically earn lower wages than men.</p>

<p>Notice that adding income to a low-income employee will result in more of that money staying in the local economy.&nbsp; In contrast, when a higher-paid employee earns more money, a larger portion of that money is spent on distant vacations, distant purchases, and distant investments.</p>

<p>Simplistically increasing the minimum wage will not significantly reduce the wage gap.&nbsp; That's the &ldquo;stick&rdquo; approach.&nbsp; What's the &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; approach?&nbsp; Specifically how can we efficiently increase what we want more of, instead of attacking what we want less of.</p>

<p>A simple method is to reduce business taxes for businesses that have smaller wage gaps.&nbsp; Here the term &ldquo;wage gap&rdquo; refers to the wage gap within a single business.&nbsp; Let's call this intra-business wage gap the &ldquo;perbiz&rdquo; &mdash; as in per-business &mdash; wage gap.</p>

<p>How can we calculate the wage gap?&nbsp; If you don't like dealing with any kind of mathematics feel free to skip the next sentence, which describes this wage gap index.&nbsp; The wage-gap index is calculated as the average wage of the top half of employees, minus the average wage of the bottom half of employees, divided by the minimum wage.</p>

<p>Businesses that have a lower perbiz wage gap index would get a bigger tax credit.&nbsp; Of course the size of the tax credit also must depend on the total amount spent on wages.</p>

<p>The state legislature will choose the size of the perbiz tax credit.&nbsp; They would start with a small tax credit, and increase it based on how well the local economy increases in prosperity.</p>

<p>Notice that this approach moves the fight between employers and employees into state legislatures.&nbsp; It would dramatically increase wages for lower-income employees.&nbsp; And it would reduce the need to strike, which would further increase overall economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Of course this economic reform would never get adopted under our current primitive election system.&nbsp; Yet it will have a chance of getting adopted when we adopt a better vote-counting system.&nbsp; This option provides yet another way in which election-method reform will significantly increase widespread economic prosperity.</p>

<h2>Problem:&nbsp; Business tax rates ignore the difference between maker businesses and taker businesses</h2>

<p>What do the voters in each city and state want more of&nbsp;?&nbsp; We want more businesses that bring lots of money into our city and state.&nbsp; This flow of money into the city or state occurs because these businesses sell to customers around the world.</p>

<p>Examples of such businesses in Washington, Oregon, and California include: Starbucks, Amazon, Nike, Hollywood movie studios, Intel, and many high-tech businesses in San Fransisco and Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>These kinds of businesses can be called &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses.&nbsp; That's because they make valuable things that are sold to customers around the world.</p>

<p>To better appreciate how maker businesses increase overall economic prosperity, consider the opposite extreme.&nbsp; They can be called &ldquo;taker&rdquo; businesses.</p>

<p>Taker businesses drag down the local economy.&nbsp; Some of them do so by mostly selling to local customers.&nbsp; Some of them send lots of their profits to distant headquarters.&nbsp; Examples of taker businesses include: insurance companies, banks, law firms, and most chain businesses including Home Depot, Walmart, Starbucks, and McDonalds.</p>

<p>Let's look at important differences between maker businesses and taker businesses.&nbsp; For simplicity let's ignore other business categories that fit between the maker and taker extremes. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>As you skim this table, notice that taker businesses tend to be the kind of businesses that exploit money-extraction tactics.&nbsp; In contrast, well-run maker businesses thrive in a free-market economy, without the need to exploit money-extraction tactics. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>Now that you recognize that maker businesses attract a flow of money from customers in many distant locations, without losing much of value, let's look at how a city or state can help foster the growth of maker businesses.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Solution:&nbsp; Reduce taxes on small maker businesses</h2>

<p>Big tax breaks are given to large maker businesses to attract them, and to discourage them from relocating.&nbsp; Usually the biggest of these tax breaks are arranged one at a time, at the request of the business.</p>

<p>Yet there are lots of small maker businesses that also earn most of their income by selling to customers outside their state or region.&nbsp; They too deserve similar tax breaks because they too attract a net flow of money into the city or state where they are located.</p>

<p>Let's call these special tax breaks &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax breaks.&nbsp; This reduced tax burden will help small maker businesses grow into big maker businesses.&nbsp; As larger businesses they will employ many more people, which increases what the city or state will gain in payroll taxes.&nbsp; And they will sell to many more non-local customers, which increases the inward flow of money.</p>

<p>Instead of expecting each small maker business to go through a process of requesting such a tax break, getting the &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax break should be as simple as checking a box on a tax form.</p>

<p>The primary qualification for this &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax break will be based on the kind of business, which the IRS already collects on tax forms as a &ldquo;business classification number.&rdquo; <sup>*</sup></p>


<p>Governments can, and should, nurture small maker businesses through something like a &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax break.&nbsp; This reduced tax burdern will make it easier for these businesses to grow into medium and large maker businesses.&nbsp; This growth will increase the number of employees, increase what the city or state receives in payroll taxes, and increase the flow of money coming from distant customers.</p>

<p>If the owner of a taker business regards this bias as unfair, they are overlooking the fact that the additional employees working for the maker business will spend some of their paychecks buying what that taker business sells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice these reforms do not attack specific businesses that exploit us as consumers or employees.&nbsp; Instead they reduce business taxes for businesses that increase a region's overall economic prosperity.&nbsp; All other businesses will continue to pay current business tax rates.</p>

<p>The result of adopting these two business-tax reforms will be dramatically increased economic prosperity across all business types.&nbsp; Remember that profits increase when more people have more money with which to buy what each business sells.</p>

<p>As a big extra bonus, these suggested legal reforms also will bring widespread increases in <i>happiness</i>.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we will have: lower consumer prices, higher wages, lower individual tax rates, fewer financial hardships, less emotional suffering, less physical suffering, less crime, less homelessness, less exposure to toxins, fewer deaths, fewer disabilities, less environmental destruction, fewer extinctions, and less-drastic climate change.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2><sup><b>*</b></sup> Clarifications</h2>

<p>Biggest political fight:&nbsp; Of course the characterization of politics as a fight between business owners and the majority of voters is simplistic.&nbsp; Most voters actually are on both sides as a result of being a shareholder, being an employee, and being a customer of many different businesses.&nbsp; The two sides are not separate.&nbsp; As a result, most of us vote for candidates who hurt us economically.</p>

<p>Business owners versus customers versus employees:&nbsp; Henry Ford recognized, and fueled, this feedback loop.&nbsp; He chose to pay his workers well so they could afford to by his cars.&nbsp; This tactic significantly increased his personal income.</p>

<p>Biggest campaign contributors:&nbsp; As evidence that the biggest fight in politics is between business owners and the majority of voters, the biggest campaign contributions come from owners (including shareholders) of the businesses listed in the left column above.&nbsp; Specifically, the people who give the most money to members of Congress are in these industries: finance, insurance, real estate, health, lawyers, communications and electronics, energy and natural resources, construction, agribusiness, transportation, and defense.&nbsp; Notice these are the businesses that involve lots of interaction with government at the city, state, and national level.</p>

<p>Both parties:&nbsp; These biggest campaign contributions go to both Republican candidates and Democratic candidates.&nbsp; Specifically the money goes to whichever candidates demonstrate a willingness to protect the money-extraction tactics that allow these business owners to earn extra profits, beyond what the business would earn in a free-market economy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoiler&rdquo; candidate:&nbsp; The presence of a &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo; candidate is not what spoils an election.&nbsp; What spoils the election is the use of a primitive vote-counting system that can change the winner just by adding a candidate who is not popular enough to win.</p>

<p>Example of spoiler in general election:&nbsp; A clear example of a business owner funding a &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo; candidate in a general election occurred in the 2022 Oregon election for state governor.&nbsp; The wealthy shareholder and co-founder of Nike corporation, Phil Knight, not only gave money to the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; Republican candidate, but also gave money to an independent candidate who was more &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; than &ldquo;conservative.&rdquo;&nbsp; That vote-splitting tactic almost caused the Republican candidate to win with the &ldquo;most votes,&rdquo; in spite of her being opposed by a strong majority of Oregon voters.&nbsp; (All three candidates were women so gender was not an issue.)</p>

<p>Obama versus Clinton:&nbsp; In the 2008 U.S. presidential Democratic <i>primary</i> election some business owners who wanted a Republican president gave money to Democratic candidate Barack Obama based on their expectation that racial bias would defeat Obama in the general election.&nbsp; Also these business owners paid for ads, notably including social-media ads, that attacked previously more popular candidate Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; This tactic successfully blocked Clinton from reaching the general election.&nbsp; However their overall goal of electing a Republican was not achieved. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>Kerry versus Edwards:&nbsp; In the 2004 Democratic presidential <i>primary</i> election some business owners who wanted a Republican President successfully blocked then-popular candidate John Edwards from reaching the general election.&nbsp; Similar candidate Howard Dean was partially funded to serve as a spoiler candidate to split votes away from Edwards.&nbsp; More money was given to pay for ads to support the more conservative Democratic candidate John Kerry.&nbsp; When Dean's popularity rose dramatically, funding to his campaign was significantly reduced.&nbsp; John Kerry won the Democratic primary election.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards some of the same business owners paid for attack ads against John Kerry, including the infamous &ldquo;swift boat&rdquo; attack ads.&nbsp; This tactic successfully contributed to the election of Republican George W. Bush as President.</p>

<p>OpenSecrets.org:&nbsp; The website at OpenSecrets.org tracks the campaign contributions to members of U.S. Congress.&nbsp; This data has a clear pattern of each industry giving money to both the Republican and Democratic parties.&nbsp; Some industries split according to internal conflicts.&nbsp; For example, banks and credit unions are both in the financial industry, but banks tend to prefer Republican candidates and credit unions tend to prefer Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>Political ads:&nbsp; Lots of voters are influenced by political ads, yet they do not have as much influence as many people believe.&nbsp; Under current conditions, a typical general election is a choice between two candidates who would never have reached the general election if both the Republican and Democratic parties were controlled by voters instead of the biggest campaign contributors.&nbsp; Also, third-party candidates will lose some of their appeal when we get better Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>Third parties:&nbsp; Lots of voters assume that both the Republican party and the Democratic party cannot be reformed so they favor third-party candidates.&nbsp; This belief is supported by observing the election results in Europe where it is easier for third-party candidates to get elected.&nbsp; Eventually it will become practical for the United States to adopt some characteristics of those election systems, and that will increase the number of third-party candidates in Congress and state legislatures.&nbsp; However, those advantageous characteristics won't become practical until we have first adopted ranked choice ballots and better vote-counting methods for use in electing mayors and governors.</p>

<p>Open primaries:&nbsp; Lots of voters want &ldquo;open primaries&rdquo; because those voters don't want to be affiliated with any political party.&nbsp; During a primary election those voters only get to vote on candidates running for non-partisan offices (such as judges and maybe city-council members).&nbsp; This limitation reduces voter turnout for primary elections.&nbsp; Yet our current system of closed primary elections also has advantages.&nbsp; It yields just one nominee from each party, which simplifies voting for voters who don't research specific candidates, and only mark their ballots based on party affiliation.&nbsp; A disadvantage of open primaries is that it becomes harder for a party to adjust their &ldquo;party platform&rdquo; by measuring the popularity of specific candidate positions.</p>

<p>Socialism:&nbsp; Understandably some business owners fear that lots of voters want socialism.&nbsp; Actually socialism advocates are more concerned about ending the money-extraction tactics listed in the first table.&nbsp; These extraction tactics are what allow &ldquo;the rich to get richer while the poor get poorer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ending these money-extraction tactics will yield better-paying jobs and more-affordable consumer products and services.&nbsp; That's what nearly everyone really wants.&nbsp; (Yes there will always be a few people who blindly advocate socialism, but they comprise only a small minority of voters.)</p>

<p>Presidential elections:&nbsp; U.S. presidential elections involve lots of complications beyond the ones in city and state elections.&nbsp; What's worth understanding is that eventually presidential elections will use a better vote-counting system, and that change can be done without amending the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; However these reforms won't become possible until ranked choice ballots are used in more state elections.&nbsp; Also worth understanding is that the &ldquo;interstate compact&rdquo; that some states have already adopted will not work as intended when there are more than two popular candidates.</p>

<p>Counting ranked choice ballots:&nbsp; Fortunately voters do not need to understand the counting details beyond whether or not the voter is allowed to rank two or more candidates at the same choice level.&nbsp; Better software will allow these marks, and will correctly count these marks.&nbsp; For now multiple counts in the same choice column are called &ldquo;overvotes&rdquo; and they have to be avoided because currently certified software does not count them in a way that matches the voter's intent.</p>

<p>Unfair results using ranked choice ballots:&nbsp; There have been two elections in the United States where ranked choice ballots were used and the wrong candidate was elected.&nbsp; These were a special election in Alaska, and a mayoral election in Burlington Vermont.&nbsp; The mistake was caused by counting software that assumes the candidate with the fewest &ldquo;transferred votes&rdquo; is always the least popular candidate.&nbsp; This mistake is easy to remedy by eliminating &ldquo;pairwise losing candidates&rdquo; when they occur.&nbsp; A pairwise losing candidate is a candidate who would lose every one-on-one competition against every other remainding candidate.</p>

<p>Money versus votes:&nbsp; After adopting ranked choice ballots, wealthy business owners will still have some extra influence because they will buy advertising, but they will have less excessive influence because they will no longer be able to exploit vote-splitting tactics.</p>

<p>Wage gap:&nbsp; The wage gap in a business can be measured by calculating the average wage of the half of employees who earn more money, and calculating the average wage of the other half of employees, subtracting the two averages, then dividing by the minimum wage.&nbsp; Businesses with lower wage gaps could be given business tax credits to motivate all businesses to reduce the wage gap in their business.&nbsp; This approach greatly reduces the need to use union strikes, or the threat of a strike, to motivate employers to increase wages.&nbsp; As an additional economic benefit, workers and essential employees tend to spend extra money locally, which improves the local economy, whereas high wage earners tend to spend more money to visit remote tourist destinations, to buy luxury goods from distant manufacturers, to buy vacation homes, and to invest in non-local financial &ldquo;products.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patent law:&nbsp; If a small business sues a large manufacturing business for patent infringement, the suit has to request stopping the manufacturing process, which allows the large business to counter-sue to request that the smaller business put money into an escrow account to cover the cost of paying assembly-line employees to be idle in case the smaller business loses the lawsuit.&nbsp; The escrow cost will bankrupt the small business.&nbsp; As a separate factor, a large business typically doesn't understand how to identify and hire inventors, which makes it harder for many large businesses to design innovative products and features.</p>

<p>Sugar:&nbsp; On the commodity market, sugar number 11 is the global sugar price and sugar number 16 is the U.S. sugar price.&nbsp; The U.S. price is always significantly higher than the global price.&nbsp; Sugar cane is grown in Florida where federal subsidies pay for the canals that make this growing possible.&nbsp; Farming sugar cane is not very profitable, but the lack of competition on the global market allows sugar refining and related businesses to earn very high profits.&nbsp; The money spent on canals reduces the money available for other priorities.&nbsp; In the past, two brothers in Florida owned sugar processing businesses, one brother registered as a Republican and gave campaign contributions to Republican candidates, and the other brother registered as a Democrat and gave campaign contributions to Democratic candidates.&nbsp; This is a clear example of the pattern that the same biggest campaign contributors control both political parties.</p>

<p>Stevia:&nbsp; Stevia does <i>not</i> work as a replacement for sugar in baking recipies.</p>

<p>Affordable housing:&nbsp; Real estate developers favor whatever gives them the highest profit when a property sells.&nbsp; That bias favors large houses (&ldquo;McMansions&rdquo;), which limits affordable housing options such as lower-cost houses, duplexes, and studio apartments.</p>

<p>Banks versus credit unions:&nbsp; Banks tend to favor Republican politicians and credit unions tend to favor Democratic politicians.&nbsp; Their fight is superimposed on the political left-versus-right conflict.</p>


<p>Obama versus Clinton:&nbsp; Hillary Clinton was blocked from reaching the general election because she promoted reforms that would have decreased the profits of some businesses.&nbsp; These campaign contributors assumed a Republican would win the general election because they were not aware that racial prejudice had been declining.&nbsp; Also they overlooked the appeal of Obama's campaign slogan of &ldquo;hope and change,&rdquo; which was interpreted to mean he would implement more reforms than the Republican candidate (John McCain).&nbsp; After that election, various tactics (which unfortunately included death threats) were used to deter the intended reforms.</p>

<p>Crime:&nbsp; In addition to less tax revenue to pay for law enforcement, the unfair laws that support the listed money-extraction tactics cause some people to believe that &ldquo;laws aren't fair,&rdquo; which reduces respect for laws, which increases crime.&nbsp; Also consider that people with less money tend to be hungry, cold, and angry, and these conditions cause these citizens to believe they won't lose much by resorting to robbery and other crimes, which often lead to violence.</p>

<p>Tax the rich:&nbsp; Some voters promote the idea of &ldquo;tax the rich&rdquo; without realizing that a business owner can avoid such individual tax increases by arranging for their business to own a vacation home, yacht, or luxury cars.&nbsp; Also there's a tendency to forget that some wealthy people, such as comedian Stephen Colbert, deserve to be wealthy because they have developed valuable skills and use these skills to benefit many people.&nbsp; (Laughing at the craziness of politics makes the world a happier place.)&nbsp; A better method of taxation is to increase taxes on businesses that do what we want less of, and reduce taxes on businesses that do what we want more of.&nbsp; These business tax reforms will better target business owners who deserve less wealth, and give tax breaks to business owners who benefit many, many people.</p>

<p>Business tax breaks:&nbsp; Governments also give huge tax breaks to farms and ranches because they are so essential to economic strength.</p>

<p>Incubators:&nbsp; Some city governments create incubators for small business that could grow into money-attracting businesses.&nbsp; Although such incubator programs provide worthwhile advantages to some startup businesses, a different growth path is needed by other startup businesses.</p>

<p>Free market:&nbsp; We as voters want something closer to a &ldquo;free market,&rdquo; which economists refer to as &ldquo;perfect competition&rdquo;.&nbsp; The academic term for extracting extra money from our wallets is &ldquo;abnormal profit.&rdquo; From a different perspective, dictators retain control by not allowing a free market, which is part of why they fight against democracy.</p>

<p>Business wisdom:&nbsp; The business books written by Clayton Christensen, who was a Harvard Business School professor, explain how businesses can earn lots of money without resorting to the kinds of money-extraction tactics listed above.</p>

<!--

<p>Clarifications not yet categorized:</p>

<p>Here we arrive at the root of our currently dysfunctional election system.&nbsp; In a general election, a voter is allowed to mark only one candidate, even when there are three or more competing candidates.&nbsp; This limitation is easy to exploit by indirectly funding a &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo; candidate who splits votes away from the most popular candidate.&nbsp; This divide-and-conquer tactic in politics is as effective as the military divide-and-conquer tactics used in warfare.</p>

<p>When any politician attempts to reform any unfair law, the affected business owners cut off future campaign contributions to that politician in the next primary election.</p>

<p>During a <i>primary</i> election, those of us who vote are limited to voting in just one party's primary election.&nbsp; In contrast, wealthy business owners often give money to candidates in both the Republican and Democratic primary elections.&nbsp; Lots of this money passes through political action committees (PACs), which makes it harder to recognize these cross-party campaign contributions.<sup>*</sup></p>

<p>This <i>blocking tactic</i> exploits the fact that each party nominates only one candidate.&nbsp; This limitation of one nominee per party arose because a party that offered two candidates almost always lost to the party that offered just one candidate.&nbsp; This unexpected result, which is called &ldquo;vote splitting,&rdquo; occurs because the candidate with the most votes is not necessarily the most popular candidate.<sup>*</sup>&nbsp; Only if a candidate <i>also</i> gets <i>more than half the votes</i> is that candidate the most popular.</p>

<p>Obviously general elections need to allow a second nominee if the party's first nominee fails to get more than half the votes.<sup>*</sup>&nbsp; The second nominee can be the candidate who gets the second-most votes.&nbsp; And of course general elections must continue to allow candidates from third parties.</p>

<p>Our existing vote-counting system makes it very affordable for business owners to control both the Republican and Democratic parties.&nbsp; Specifically, for each dollar a business owner contributes to help a politician get elected, the business earns at least 10 or 20 dollars through their favorite money-extraction tactics.</p>

<p>The failure to implement these reforms is what currently drags down our economy.&nbsp; Each of the money-extraction tactics in isolation appears to have just a small effect.&nbsp; However, there are thousands of businesses all squeezing extra profits out of consumers and employees.&nbsp; That's a huge burden on our economy.&nbsp; All together they squeeze excessive amounts of money from the wallets of consumers who become unable to buy what other business owners want to sell more of.</p>
