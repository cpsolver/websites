<h1 class="title">Why&nbsp;A&nbsp;Better Vote&#8209;Counting&nbsp;System Will&nbsp;Yield Widespread&nbsp;Economic&nbsp;Prosperity</h1>

<p class="text_center font_size_author">Written by Richard Fobes</p>

<p class="text_center">Author of<br /><i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i><br />and<br /><i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i></p>

<p class="small_font text_center text_wide_margin">When you &ldquo;read&rdquo; this article the first time, just look at the lists and ignore the paragraphs, or read the few paragraphs and just briefly look at the lists.&nbsp; Asterisks indicate that clarifications appear at the end of this article.
</p>

<p>The biggest fight in politics is between business owners and the majority of voters.<sup>*</sup>&nbsp; Surprisingly there are ways to benefit <i>both</i> business owners and the rest of us.&nbsp; These reforms will enable both business owners and the rest of us to soar to new heights of economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Here's the key to understanding how prosperity can increase for business owners, and customers, and employees.&nbsp; Recognize that customers, employees, and shareholders can be, and often are, the same person.</p>

<p>Specifically, consider that when a pharmaceutical business uses unfair tactics that increase the cost of a medication a person uses, the person has less money to become the customer of a different business.&nbsp; And when the person's employer uses unfair tactics that reduce the person's wages, the person cannot afford to become a consumer of products sold by yet other businesses.&nbsp; And when the same person owns shares of yet other businesses as part of their Wall Street investments, the executives of those businesses are likely to be giving lots of campaign funds to politicians who pass laws that allow those businesses to extract extra money from the person's wallet as a customer.</p>

<p>In other words, we no longer live in a world where nobles and peasants are easy to identify.&nbsp; Instead we are all tightly interconnected.&nbsp; As a result, the world economy is dragged down each time a business extracts extra money from a customer, or from an employee.&nbsp; That extra extraction takes money away from other businesses who sell what the customer also would buy if they had more money.</p>

<p>In the following sections you will learn about, or be reminded of, money-extraction tactics, wage-suppression tactics, and tactics that block the kinds of businesses we, as customers, want more of.&nbsp; Although these tactics are unethical, they are legal because state and federal laws have been written to support these unethical tactics.&nbsp; State legislatures and Congress approved these laws because our elected representatives get most of their biggest campaign contributions from the owners of the kinds of businesses that exploit these unethical extraction and suppression tactics.</p>

<p>The simple solution to this economy-draining feedback loop is to replace our primitive vote-counting system with a better vote-counting system that resists being exploited in ways that involve money.&nbsp; Then we, the majority of voters, will fully control both Republican and Democratic legislators in state legislatures.&nbsp; Then our reformed state legislatures will adopt long-overdue legal reforms that reduce, and eventually eliminate, the unethical tactics that extract extra money from our wallets as customers and employees.&nbsp; Lots of this extra money in our wallets will flow to businesses that attract money from distant customers.&nbsp; This inbound financial flow will yield higher levels of economic prosperity for the states and nations that adopt these reforms.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Problem:&nbsp; Money extraction from customers</h2>

<p>To better understand how nearly everyone can get what they want, let's start with a list of money-extraction tactics that specific kinds of businesses use to extract extra money from their customers.</p>

<p>The list is long, so don't bother reading everything in the list.&nbsp; Especially if you're seeing this list for the first time.</p>

<p>Each of the money-extraction tactics in isolation drags down our economy by a relatively small amount.&nbsp; However, they are used by a huge number of large and medium-sized businesses, so all together these tactics squeeze huge amounts of money from our wallets.</p>

<p>If you recognize that you financially benefit from one of these money-extraction tactics, consider that <i>&ldquo;your&rdquo;</i> business will sell more products and services when <i>other</i> business owners in this list have stopped using <i>their</i> tactics to remove money from <i>your</i> customers, and <i>your</i> future customers.</p>

<p>From our perspective as consumers and voters, these money-extraction tactics yield higher consumer prices.&nbsp; That's exactly the opposite of what we want.&nbsp; We want lower consumer prices.</p>

<p>Lower consumer prices will allow us to buy more of what other businesses sell.&nbsp; In turn, that increased consumption will significantly increase economic prosperity. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>As a further benefit, there will be fewer negative side effects.&nbsp; Remember that some of these money-extraction tactics lead to death, injury, disease, depression, unhappiness, and environmental destruction.</p>

<p>Now let's look at how we, the majority of voters, can begin to defeat these money-extraction tactics.&nbsp; It involves increasing voter control over who gets elected to state legislatures and Congress.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Solution:&nbsp; Election system reform</h2>

<p>To better understand how owners of some businesses win the political fight against us, the majority of voters, let's look at the <i>election-manipulation</i> tactics these business owners use to control both the Republican and Democratic parties.&nbsp; Also let's look at how to defeat these election-manipulation tactics.</p>

<p>The most important part of the solution is to change our ballots.&nbsp; Our ballots need to ask for more than just our first choice.&nbsp; The ballot also needs to ask for our second choice, third choice, and so on, for as many candidates as we want to rank.&nbsp; This kind of ballot is called a &ldquo;ranked choice ballot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It's easy to count ranked choice ballots in a way that correctly identifies which candidate deserves to become a mayor, governor, or president.&nbsp; And it's easy for software to count ranked choice ballots in ways that fill state legislatures and Congress with the people who better represent most voters.</p>

<p>As you read about these election-manipulation tactics, keep in mind that during the primary election the biggest campaign contributors directly or indirectly contribute money to candidates in <i>both</i> political parties. <sup>*</sup>&nbsp; This primary-election blocking tactic robs us, the majority of voters, from getting a reform-minded candidate from either party in the general election.</p>

<p>If a well-designed election system had been adopted long before these elections, either the political views of these candidates would have changed, or different candidates would have been in these elections.&nbsp; That's because we, the voters, would have been able to elect the reform-minded leaders we want.&nbsp; Instead, using our current primitive election system, we get stuck with politicians who are basically special-interest puppets.</p>

<p>If these historic elections suddently switched to a better election system just before the primary election, and the same candidates were on the ballot, we don't know who would have won.&nbsp; That's because ranked choice ballots were not used in opinion polls.</p>

<p>When opinion pollsters start asking voters for their second choice and third choice, and not just their first choice, we will find out which candidate is actually most popular in each election.</p>

<p>Imagine the result of adopting a well-designed election system.&nbsp; Congress will be filled with reform-minded leaders instead of special-interest puppets.&nbsp; Lots of big problems will quickly fade away into history.&nbsp; To appreciate this transformation, recall that England, France, Germany, and Italy fought wars about whether a citizen was allowed to be a Protestant or Catholic.&nbsp; Those wars ended when democracy arrived.&nbsp; In a similar way, when we reach higher levels of democracy, the current political fights about assault weapons, abortion, and racial bias will fade into history.&nbsp; Even better, the money-extraction tactics listed above will be reduced.&nbsp; That will give consumers and voters more money to buy what other businesses sell.&nbsp; This is the better economic future that will arrive when we adopt a better vote-counting system.</p>

<p>How will ranked-choice ballot marks be counted?&nbsp; Unfortunately the answer is confusing. <sup>*</sup>&nbsp; Fortunately this confusion will disappear when better election software becomes available, and when better videos become available to explain how the counting is done.</p>

<p>The result of adopting wisely designed ranked choice ballots, and wisely designed election software, will be to <i>increase</i> the influence of voters, and <i>decrease</i> the effectiveness of the biggest campaign contributions.</p>

<p>Currently we are stuck in a bad feedback loop in which &ldquo;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer&rdquo; and too many resources &mdash; including time, fuel, money, machines, computers, and brainpower &mdash; are wasted.&nbsp; We need to switch to the good feedback loop in which &ldquo;wealth flows to businesses and employees that make the world a better place, and fewer resources are wasted.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understandably many business owners are afraid of adopting ranked choice ballots.&nbsp; They know they will lose some of their control over politicians.&nbsp; Mistakenly they also fear they will suffer economically.&nbsp; After all, the dominant goal behind the biggest campaign contributions is to stop politicians from adopting the reforms the majority of voters want.</p>

<p>Yet, as stated at the beginning of this article, most business owners will earn more money, not less money, when voters have more control over election outcomes.&nbsp; That's because elected representatives will bring an end to the unethical tactics that extract extra money from the wallets of customers.&nbsp; With more money in their wallets, more customers will be able to afford more of what other businesses sell.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Problem:&nbsp; Wage extraction from employees</h2>

<p>Remember that the biggest fight in politics is between business owners and the majority of voters.&nbsp; The largest part of this fight is about wages.</p>

<p>Most business owners want to pay wages that are as low as possible.&nbsp; This goal is reasonable if the low-income employees have enough money to pay for more than just food and rent.&nbsp; But if the low-income employees need to get food and housing assistance from government-funded programs, that's not reasonable because those wage-extraction tactics shift the financial burden to taxpayers.</p>

<p>In contrast, most employees want higher wages.&nbsp; This goal is reasonable for employees who do the work that customers, clients, and patients are paying for.&nbsp; And this goal is especially reasonable if the business owner is living in luxury, and would not suffer by sharing a small portion of their current income.</p>

<p>Here's a list of wage-suppression tactics that business owners use to reduce how much money they pay employees.&nbsp; As you skim this list, keep in mind that reduced wages drag down the overall economy because the employees are also customers, and potential customers, of other businesses.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these wage-suppression tactics bring down the overall economy.&nbsp; The suppression occurs because employees who work for a business that pays lower wages have less money available to buy what other businesses sell.&nbsp; Then the <i>other</i> businesses earn less money, which limits how much <i>they</i> can pay <i>their</i> employees.&nbsp; And then those employees have less money to buy what the original business sells.</p>

<p>Here's a list of reasons why our current high wage gap undermines our economy, and why a smaller wage gap will strengthen our economy.&nbsp; For simplicity this list ignores employees in the middle wage range.</p>

<p>Now that you appreciate that economic prosperity will increase by increasing the wages of low-wage employees, let's look at how to reward businesses that voluntarily choose to reduce the wage gap within their business.</p>


<!--
<p>It's a feedback loop.&nbsp; This feedback loop is bad when it spirals downward to increasingly lower levels of prosperity.&nbsp; That's what's happening now.&nbsp; Yet this same feedback loop also can spiral upward to higher levels of prosperity.&nbsp; That's what everyone wants. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>How can we switch from the bad feedback loop to the good feedback loop?</p>

<h2>Solution:&nbsp; &ldquo;Perbiz&rdquo; wage-gap tax break</h2>



<p>Simplistically increasing the minimum wage will not significantly reduce the wage gap.&nbsp; That's the &ldquo;stick&rdquo; approach.&nbsp; What's the &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; approach?&nbsp; Specifically how can we efficiently increase what we want more of, instead of attacking what we want less of?</p>

<p>A simple method is to reduce business taxes for businesses that have smaller wage gaps.&nbsp; Here the term &ldquo;wage gap&rdquo; refers to the wage gap within a single business.&nbsp; Let's call this intra-business wage gap the &ldquo;perbiz&rdquo; &mdash; as in per-business &mdash; wage gap.</p>

<p>How can we calculate the wage gap?&nbsp; If you don't like dealing with any kind of mathematics feel free to skip the next sentence, which describes this wage gap index.&nbsp; The wage-gap index is calculated as the average wage of the top half of employees, minus the average wage of the bottom half of employees, divided by the minimum wage.</p>

<p>Businesses that have a lower perbiz wage gap index will get a bigger tax credit.&nbsp; Of course the size of the tax credit also must depend on the total amount spent on wages.</p>

<p>The state legislature will choose the size of the perbiz tax credit.&nbsp; They will start with a small tax credit, and increase it based on how well the local economy increases in prosperity.</p>

<p>Notice that this approach moves the fight between employers and employees into state legislatures.&nbsp; It will dramatically increase wages for lower-income employees.&nbsp; And it will reduce the need to strike, which will further increase overall economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Of course this economic reform will never get adopted while we still use our current primitive election system.&nbsp; And if, somehow, it were adopted without reforming our election system, the biggest campaign contributors would write the rules to benefit themselves, not to benefit the overall economy.</p>

<p>This reform is much more likely to get adopted when we have adopted a better vote-counting system.&nbsp; This difference is yet another reason why election-method reform will significantly increase widespread economic prosperity.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Problem:&nbsp; Business tax rates ignore the difference between maker businesses and taker businesses</h2>

<p>What do the voters in each city and state want more of&nbsp;?&nbsp; We want more businesses that bring lots of money into our city and state.&nbsp; This flow of money into the city or state occurs because these businesses sell to customers around the world.</p>

<p>Examples of such businesses in Washington, Oregon, and California include: Starbucks, Amazon, Nike, Hollywood movie studios, Intel, and many high-tech businesses in San Fransisco and Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>These kinds of businesses can be called &ldquo;maker&rdquo; businesses.&nbsp; That's because they make valuable things that are sold to customers around the world.&nbsp; Or, as demonstrated by Amazon, they have made business processes that dramatically reduce the cost of selling to, or buying from, people around the world.</p>

<p>To better appreciate how maker businesses increase overall economic prosperity, consider the opposite extreme.&nbsp; They can be called &ldquo;taker&rdquo; businesses.</p>

<p>Taker businesses drag down the local economy.&nbsp; Some of them do so by mostly selling to local customers.&nbsp; Some of them send lots of their profits to distant headquarters.&nbsp; Examples of taker businesses include: insurance companies, banks, law firms, and most chain businesses including Home Depot, Walmart, and McDonalds.</p>

<p>Let's look at important differences between maker businesses and taker businesses.&nbsp; For simplicity let's ignore other business categories that fit between the maker and taker extremes. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>As you skim this list, notice that taker businesses tend to be the kind of businesses that exploit money-extraction tactics.&nbsp; In contrast, well-run maker businesses thrive in a free-market economy, without the need to exploit money-extraction tactics. <sup>*</sup></p>

<p>Now that you recognize that maker businesses attract a flow of money from customers in many distant locations, without losing much of value, let's look at how a city or state can help foster the growth of maker businesses.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Solution:&nbsp; Reduce taxes on small maker businesses</h2>

<p>Big tax breaks are given to large maker businesses to attract them, and to discourage them from relocating.&nbsp; Usually the biggest of these tax breaks are arranged one at a time, at the request of the business.</p>

<p>Yet there are lots of small maker businesses that also earn most of their income by selling to customers outside their state or region.&nbsp; They too deserve similar tax breaks because they too attract a net flow of money into the city or state where they are located.</p>

<p>Let's call these special tax breaks &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax breaks.&nbsp; This reduced tax burden will help small maker businesses grow into big maker businesses.&nbsp; As larger businesses they will employ many more people, which increases what the city or state will gain in payroll taxes.&nbsp; And they will sell to many more non-local customers, which increases the incoming flow of money.</p>

<p>Instead of expecting each small maker business to go through a process of requesting such a tax break, getting the &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax break should be as simple as checking a box on a tax form.</p>

<p>The primary qualification for this &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax break will be based on the kind of business, which the IRS already collects on tax forms as a &ldquo;NAICS&rdquo; (North American Industry Classification System) code number. <sup>*</sup></p>


<p>Governments can, and should, nurture small maker businesses through something like a &ldquo;maker-biz&rdquo; tax break.&nbsp; This reduced tax burdern will make it easier for these businesses to grow into medium and large maker businesses.&nbsp; This growth will increase the number of employees, increase what the city or state receives in payroll taxes, and increase the flow of money coming from distant customers.</p>

<p>If the owner of a taker business regards this bias as unfair, they are overlooking the fact that the additional employees working for the maker business will spend some of their employment income buying what that taker business sells.</p>

<p>Notice these reforms do not involve any bias for, or against, either the Republican party or the Democratic party.&nbsp; Instead they reduce business taxes for businesses that increase a region's overall economic prosperity.&nbsp; All other businesses will continue to pay current business tax rates.</p>

<p>The result of adopting these three reforms will be dramatically increased economic prosperity across all business types.&nbsp; Remember that profits increase when more people have more money with which to buy what each business sells.</p>

<p>As a big extra bonus, these suggested legal reforms also will bring widespread increases in <i>happiness</i>.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we will have: lower consumer prices, higher wages, lower individual tax rates, fewer financial hardships, less emotional suffering, less physical suffering, less crime, less homelessness, less exposure to toxins, fewer deaths, fewer disabilities, less environmental destruction, fewer extinctions, and less-drastic climate change.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2><sup><b>*</b></sup> Clarifications</h2>

<p>Author bias:&nbsp; I, the author, admit to being biased against both the Republican party and the Democratic party, and against any other specific political party.&nbsp; I switch registration between Republican and Democratic parties so I can influence at least one of the parties.&nbsp; And I admit to being biased against businesses that extract unfair extra money from customers and employees.&nbsp; And I am biased against the corruption of the healthcare industry.&nbsp; Yet I am pro-business if the business operates with fairness.&nbsp; Briefly I have experienced being a corporate CEO, commodity trader, landlord, trustee, estate executor, manual laborer, retail clerk, handyman, mechanic, electronics technician, author, neighborhood organizer, and dance instructor.&nbsp; Fairness is very important to me.&nbsp; That's the priority that led to becoming &ldquo;the VoteFair guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Biggest political fight:&nbsp; Of course the characterization of politics as a fight between business owners and the majority of voters is simplistic.&nbsp; Most voters actually are on both sides as a result of being a shareholder, being an employee, and being a customer of many different businesses.&nbsp; The two sides are not separate.&nbsp; As a result, most of us vote for candidates who hurt us economically.</p>

<p>Business owners versus customers versus employees:&nbsp; Henry Ford recognized, and fueled, this feedback loop.&nbsp; He chose to pay his workers well so they could afford to by his cars.&nbsp; This tactic significantly increased his personal income.</p>

<p>Biggest campaign contributors:&nbsp; As evidence that the biggest fight in politics is between business owners and the majority of voters, the biggest campaign contributions come from owners (including shareholders) of the businesses listed in the left column above.&nbsp; Specifically, the people who give the most money to members of Congress are in these industries: finance, insurance, real estate, health, lawyers, communications and electronics, energy and natural resources, construction, agribusiness, transportation, and defense.&nbsp; Notice many of these businesses involve lots of interactions with government at the city, state, and national level.&nbsp; All the biggest campaign contributors oppose what most voters want.&nbsp; If they didn't, they wouldn't waste their money trying to control election results.&nbsp; The owners of many other kinds of businesses, especially smaller ones, also give campaign contributions, but the total amount of their contributions is much smaller.</p>

<p>Both parties:&nbsp; These biggest campaign contributions go to both Republican candidates and Democratic candidates.&nbsp; Specifically the money goes to whichever candidates demonstrate a willingness to protect the money-extraction tactics that allow these business owners to earn extra profits, beyond what the business would earn in a free-market economy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoiler&rdquo; candidate:&nbsp; The presence of a &ldquo;spoiler&rdquo; candidate is not what spoils an election.&nbsp; What spoils the election is the use of a primitive vote-counting system that can change the winner just by adding a candidate who is not popular enough to win.</p>

<p>Second nominee:&nbsp; Another advantage of a second nominee is that conditions can change between the primary and general election.&nbsp; In particular, the opposite party's candidate cannot automatically win by promoting scandalous news about the first nominee.&nbsp; Also it eliminates the motivation to cause harm to a single nominee, which increases resistance to authoritarianism.</p>

<p>OpenSecrets.org:&nbsp; The website at OpenSecrets.org tracks the campaign contributions to members of U.S. Congress.&nbsp; This data has a clear pattern of each industry giving money to both the Republican and Democratic parties.&nbsp; Some industries split according to internal conflicts.&nbsp; For example, banks and credit unions are both in the financial industry, but banks tend to prefer Republican candidates and credit unions tend to prefer Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>Political ads:&nbsp; Lots of voters are influenced by political ads, yet they do not have as much influence as many people believe.&nbsp; Under current conditions, a typical general election is a choice between two candidates who would never have reached the general election if both the Republican and Democratic parties were controlled by voters instead of the biggest campaign contributors.&nbsp; Also, third-party candidates will lose some of their appeal when we get better Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>One nominee per party:&nbsp; The blocking tactic exploits the fact that each party nominates only one candidate.&nbsp; This limit arose because a party that offered two candidates almost always lost to the party that offered just one candidate.&nbsp; This unexpected result, which is called &ldquo;vote splitting,&rdquo; occurs because the candidate with the most votes is not necessarily the most popular candidate.<sup>*</sup>&nbsp; Only if a candidate <i>also</i> gets <i>more than half the votes</i> is that candidate the most popular.</p>

<p>Third parties:&nbsp; Lots of voters assume that both the Republican party and the Democratic party cannot be reformed so they favor third-party candidates.&nbsp; This belief is supported by observing the election results in Europe where it is easier for third-party candidates to get elected.&nbsp; Eventually it will become practical for the United States to adopt some characteristics of those election systems, and that will increase the number of third-party candidates in Congress and state legislatures.&nbsp; However, those advantageous characteristics won't become practical until we have first adopted ranked choice ballots and better vote-counting methods for use in electing mayors and governors.</p>

<p>Open primaries:&nbsp; Lots of voters want &ldquo;open primaries&rdquo; because those voters don't want to be affiliated with any political party.&nbsp; During a primary election those voters only get to vote on candidates running for non-partisan offices (such as judges and maybe city-council members).&nbsp; This limitation reduces voter turnout for primary elections.&nbsp; Yet our current system of closed primary elections also has advantages.&nbsp; It yields just one nominee from each party, which simplifies voting for voters who don't research specific candidates, and only mark their ballots based on party affiliation.&nbsp; A disadvantage of open primaries is that it becomes harder for a party to adjust their &ldquo;party platform&rdquo; by measuring the popularity of specific candidate positions.</p>

<p>Statewide seats:&nbsp; If a ballot doesn't ask the voter for a favorite party, the party of the highest-ranked candidate can be used for these calculations.</p>

<p>Affordability of campaign contributions:&nbsp; Our existing vote-counting system makes it very affordable for business owners to control both the Republican and Democratic parties.&nbsp; For each dollar a business owner contributes to help a politician get elected, the business earns at least 10 or 20 dollars through their favorite money-extraction tactics.&nbsp; When any politician attempts to reform any unfair law, the affected business owners cut off future campaign contributions to that politician and shift their support to a puppet-like politician in the next primary election.</p>

<p>Socialism:&nbsp; Understandably some business owners fear that lots of voters want socialism.&nbsp; Actually socialism advocates are more concerned about ending the money-extraction tactics listed in the first list.&nbsp; These extraction tactics are what allow &ldquo;the rich to get richer while the poor get poorer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ending these money-extraction tactics will yield better-paying jobs and more-affordable consumer products and services.&nbsp; That's what nearly everyone really wants.&nbsp; Yes there will always be a few people who blindly advocate socialism, or advocate a &ldquo;universal basic income,&rdquo; but they comprise only a small minority of voters.</p>

<p>Presidential elections:&nbsp; U.S. presidential elections involve lots of complications beyond the ones in city and state elections.&nbsp; What's worth understanding is that eventually presidential elections will use a better vote-counting system, and that change can be done without amending the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; However these reforms won't become possible until ranked choice ballots are used in more state elections.&nbsp; Also worth understanding is that the &ldquo;interstate compact&rdquo; that some states have already adopted will not work as intended when there are more than two popular candidates.</p>

<p>Counting ranked choice ballots:&nbsp; Fortunately voters do not need to understand the counting details beyond whether or not the voter is allowed to rank two or more candidates at the same choice level.&nbsp; Better software will allow these marks, and will correctly count these marks.&nbsp; For now multiple counts in the same choice column are called &ldquo;overvotes&rdquo; and they have to be avoided because currently certified software does not count them in a way that matches the voter's intent.</p>

<p>Unfair results using ranked choice ballots:&nbsp; There have been two elections in the United States where ranked choice ballots were used and the wrong candidate was elected.&nbsp; These were a special election in Alaska, and a mayoral election in Burlington Vermont.&nbsp; The mistake was caused by counting software that assumes the candidate with the fewest &ldquo;transferred votes&rdquo; is always the least popular candidate.&nbsp; This mistake is easy to remedy by eliminating &ldquo;pairwise losing candidates&rdquo; when they occur.&nbsp; A pairwise losing candidate is a candidate who would lose every one-on-one competition against every other remainding candidate.</p>

<p>Money versus votes:&nbsp; After adopting ranked choice ballots, wealthy business owners will still have some extra influence because they will buy advertising, but they will have less excessive influence because they will no longer be able to exploit vote-splitting tactics.</p>

<p>Wage gap:&nbsp; The wage gap in a business can be measured by calculating the average wage of the half of employees who earn more money, and calculating the average wage of the other half of employees, subtracting the two averages, then dividing by the minimum wage.&nbsp; Businesses with lower wage gaps could be given business tax credits to motivate all businesses to reduce the wage gap in their business.&nbsp; This approach greatly reduces the need to use union strikes, or the threat of a strike, to motivate employers to increase wages.&nbsp; As an additional economic benefit, workers and essential employees tend to spend extra money locally, which improves the local economy, whereas high wage earners tend to spend more money to visit remote tourist destinations, to buy luxury goods from distant manufacturers, to buy vacation homes, and to invest in non-local financial &ldquo;products.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patent law:&nbsp; If a small business sues a large manufacturing business for patent infringement, the suit has to request stopping the manufacturing process, which allows the large business to counter-sue to request that the smaller business put money into an escrow account to cover the cost of paying assembly-line employees to be idle in case the smaller business loses the lawsuit.&nbsp; The escrow cost will bankrupt the small business.&nbsp; As a separate factor, a large business typically doesn't understand how to identify and hire inventors, which makes it harder for many large businesses to design innovative products and features.</p>

<p>Sugar:&nbsp; On the commodity market, sugar number 11 is the global sugar price and sugar number 16 is the U.S. sugar price.&nbsp; The U.S. price is always significantly higher than the global price.&nbsp; Sugar cane is grown in Florida where federal subsidies pay for the canals that make this growing possible.&nbsp; Farming sugar cane is not very profitable, but the lack of competition on the global market allows sugar refining and related businesses to earn very high profits.&nbsp; The money spent on canals reduces the money available for other priorities.&nbsp; In the past, two brothers in Florida owned sugar processing businesses, one brother registered as a Republican and gave campaign contributions to Republican candidates, and the other brother registered as a Democrat and gave campaign contributions to Democratic candidates.&nbsp; This is a clear example of the pattern that the same biggest campaign contributors control both political parties.</p>

<p>Stevia:&nbsp; Stevia does <i>not</i> work as a replacement for sugar in baking recipies.</p>

<p>Healthcare and health insurance:&nbsp; Ideally voters would like elected representatives in Congress to rely on the same healthcare system the rest of us use.&nbsp; That would motivate them to quickly reform our healthcare system.</p>

<p>Affordable housing:&nbsp; Real estate developers favor whatever gives them the highest profit when a property sells.&nbsp; This bias favors large houses.&nbsp; This bias intentionally limits affordable housing options such as lower-cost houses, duplexes, studio apartments, and &ldquo;dwelling units&rdquo; built next to an existing house.&nbsp; The resulting shortage of more-affordable housing options inflates prices for all housing options.</p>

<p>Banks versus credit unions:&nbsp; Banks tend to favor Republican politicians and credit unions tend to favor Democratic politicians.&nbsp; Their fight is superimposed on the political left-versus-right conflict.</p>

<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):&nbsp; Economists often use GDP to measure economic prosperity.&nbsp; However, GDP measures transfers of money without recognizing that some money transfers measure the consequences of undesirable events, such as paying funeral expenses and cleaning up oil spills.&nbsp; Also, some money transfers are not productive, such as when one business contracts with another business for the purpose of avoiding taxes, protecting against lawsuits, or exploiting employment loopholes.</p>

<p>Healthy results:&nbsp; Another weakness of traditional modern medicine is a heavy emphasis on death rates, and much less emphasis on quality of life.&nbsp; Partially this occurs because death rates are easier to measure.&nbsp; Also, doctors and pharmaceutical companies refer to death rates when they discuss cancer treatments because those treatments do not &ldquo;cure&rdquo; cancer.</p>

<p>Obama versus Clinton:&nbsp; Hillary Clinton was blocked from reaching the general election because she promoted reforms that would have decreased the profits of some businesses.&nbsp; Obama's campaign slogan of &ldquo;hope and change,&rdquo; was interpreted to mean he would implement more reforms than the Republican candidate (John McCain), but after the election, various tactics (which unfortunately included death threats) were used to deter the intended reforms.</p>

<p>Crime:&nbsp; In addition to less tax revenue to pay for law enforcement, the unfair laws that support the listed money-extraction tactics cause some people to believe that &ldquo;laws aren't fair,&rdquo; which reduces respect for laws, which increases crime.&nbsp; Also consider that people with less money tend to be hungry, cold, and angry, and these conditions cause these citizens to believe they won't lose much by resorting to robbery and other crimes, which often lead to violence.</p>

<p>Tax the rich:&nbsp; Some voters promote the idea of &ldquo;tax the rich&rdquo; without realizing that a business owner can avoid such individual tax increases by arranging for their business to own a vacation home, yacht, or luxury cars.&nbsp; Also there's a tendency to forget that some wealthy people, such as comedian Stephen Colbert, deserve to be wealthy because they have developed valuable skills and use these skills to benefit many people.&nbsp; (Laughing at the craziness of politics makes the world a happier place.)&nbsp; A better method of taxation is to increase taxes on businesses that do what we want less of, and reduce taxes on businesses that do what we want more of.&nbsp; These business tax reforms will better target business owners who deserve less wealth, and give tax breaks to business owners who benefit many, many people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trickle down&rdqul; economics:&nbsp; Business owners often claim that increases in income to high-wage employees will trickle down to lower-wage citizens.&nbsp; This belief ignores the importance of the direction of money flow.&nbsp; Money that flows out of state is an economic loss.&nbsp; In contrast, money that trickles down and stays in the same region will help the local economy.</p>

<p>Business tax breaks:&nbsp; Governments also give huge tax breaks to farms and ranches because they are so essential to economic strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NAICS&rdquo; (North American Industry Classification System) code numbers:&nbsp; The first two digits of these numbers indicate a general category.&nbsp; The categories that can deserve the maker-biz tax breaks include categories 23, 31, 32, 33, 51, 54, 71, 72, and 81.&nbps; Categories 11 and 21 already get tax breaks.&nbsp; Categories that do not deserve the maker-biz tax breaks are categories 22, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 91, and 92.&nbsp; The remaining categories depend on additional information.</p>

<p>Incubators:&nbsp; Some city governments create incubators for small business that could grow into money-attracting businesses.&nbsp; Although such incubator programs provide worthwhile advantages to some startup businesses, a different growth path is needed by other startup businesses.</p>

<p>Free market:&nbsp; We as voters want something closer to a &ldquo;free market,&rdquo; which economists refer to as &ldquo;perfect competition&rdquo;.&nbsp; The academic term for extracting extra money from our wallets is &ldquo;abnormal profit.&rdquo; From a different perspective, dictators retain control by not allowing a free market, which is part of why they fight against democracy.</p>

<p>Categories between maker and taker:&nbsp; These categories include retail, transportation, communication (of what already exists), healthcare, and maintenance.</p>

<p>Business wisdom:&nbsp; The business books written by Clayton Christensen, who was a Harvard Business School professor, explain how businesses can earn lots of money without resorting to the kinds of money-extraction tactics listed above.</p>
