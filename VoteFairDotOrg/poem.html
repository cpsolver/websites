Abe and Thomas for President</font></h1>

<blockquote>
'Twas the night before campaigning, and all through the nation<br />
politicians' bank accounts bulged in anticipation.<br />
The voters were couched watching shows on TV<br />
with dreams of finance reform restoring democracy,<br />
while top party leaders planned rhetoric to hide<br />
the wide gap between voters and the wealthy at their side.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The marble statue of Lincoln on the mall in D.C.<br />
watched Congress being influenced by legal bribery.<br />
On that warm summer night at the memorial to Lincoln<br />
a few tourists were shocked when his eyes started blinkin'.<br />
Then larger than life Lincoln arose with a clatter.<br />
Smelling the air, Abe said "I'll fix this matter."</blockquote>

<blockquote>
At the memorial to Jefferson he gave Tom a nudge.<br />
Tourists gasped to see move what they thought wouldn't budge.<br />
"Democracy's been lost, the voters are ignored,<br />
the rich vote with dollars 'n get a bigger reward,"<br />
the two ex-presidents nodded and agreed,<br />
"A wise un-moneyed alternative is what voters need."</blockquote>

<blockquote>
To the delight of voters, the two entered the race<br />
with Lincoln for prez and Jeff in second place.<br />
They promised to voters what contributors had blocked,<br />
such as gun laws that only the NRA knocked,<br />
and stopping timber sales for a few bucks a tree<br />
on government lands using logging roads free.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Just look," said Thomas "at the biggest contributors:<br />
the lawyers and doctors, the military contractors,<br />
pharmaceuticals, bankers, the insurance industry,<br />
all backing lobbyists who stalk the halls of D.C.<br />
While paying Congress for legalized monopoly,<br />
they block health care reform and a stronger economy."</blockquote>

<blockquote>
So Jefferson put forth wise solutions from his brain,<br />
but between ads, media's agenda was to entertain.<br />
They chose sound bites that distorted speeches Abe gave,<br />
and dug into stories 'bout (widower) Tom's mistress, a slave.<br />
Of mudslingin' reports, smart voters were bored,<br />
so for unbiased info went to Vote Smart dot org.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Becoming scared by Abe's and Thomas' success,<br />
the campaign contributors increased their largess.<br />
The more they opposed the voters' agenda,<br />
the more they became an even bigga' spenda'.<br />
From owners of casinos, dealers in tobacco,<br />
and stock marketeers, more money did flow.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In spite of the money that went into the race,<br />
the big-party candidates couldn't keep pace.<br />
They lost more ground in the presidential debate,<br />
so when election day came the excitement was great.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Finally, fifty eight percent put Abe first of three,<br />
twenty four for the elephant, and eighteen for the donkey.<br />
With the Electoral College rules and their vagary<br />
this became forty five, thirty two, and twenty three.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Lacking a majority, the Constitution was consulted.<br />
Most people were surprised at what resulted.<br />
In this case, which happened just twice in history,<br />
the house of representatives vote among the top three,<br />
with a surprising twist: each state gets one vote.<br />
Realizing this, voters lost what was left of their hope.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
House Republicans and Democrats all voted for their own,<br />
so the voters once more had a reason to groan;<br />
not one vote was cast for the voter's top choice.<br />
Instead, the elephant's pick was the one to rejoice.<br />
So party backers celebrated continued monopolies,<br />
their tax-paid subsidies, and anti-voter priorities.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Abe and Tom, for advanced voting methods did promote.<br />
"You now have computers, so voters can vote<br />
for more than one choice," said Tom fervently.<br />
"Try it out at VoteFair dot org and you'll see<br />
that VoteFair produces a fair outcome for you<br />
when, in a race, there are candidates more than two."</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"We certainly know it won't happen soon,<br />
but longer we'll wait 'til a time opportune.<br />
We'll rise once again if the need should be there.<br />
With VoteFair ranking the results will be fair."<br />
With that Abe and Tom turned back into stone,<br />
and waited for voting to reach that milestone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Now voters understood why only two parties exist,<br />
and realized fair voting bypassed funding influence.<br />
So VoteFair ranking was used in board elections,<br />
then elections in cities, counties, and corp'rations,<br />
then elections for senators and reps from each state,<br />
while Lincoln and Jefferson continued to wait.</blockquote>
