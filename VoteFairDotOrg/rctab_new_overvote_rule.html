<h1>Request to Add New <i>RCTab</i> Overvote Rule Named &ldquo;<i>Temporarily Inactive When Multiple Continuing</i>&rdquo;</h1>

<p>This document describes a new <b>Overvote Rule</b> that should be added to the RCTab software maintained by the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center (RCVRC).</p>

<p>This new rule <b>temporarily</b> counts a ballot as <i><b>inactive</b></i> if, during the current counting round, two or more <i><b>continuing</b></i> (not yet eliminated) candidates are marked at the <b>same <i>rank</i></b> column.&nbsp; The ballot is restored to <i><b>active</b></i> when just one of the overvoted candidates is <i><b>continuing</b></i>.&nbsp; Only after all the overvoted candidates in a column are eliminated does counting progress to the next <i>rank</i> column.</p>



<h2>Why Add This New Overvote Rule?</h2>

<p>Here are reasons why this new overvote rule needs to be added.</p>

<ul>

<li>Counts overvotes in a way that better <b>honors the voter's clearly indicated intent</b>.&nbsp; In contrast, all three existing overvote rules &mdash; &ldquo;<i>Exhaust immediately</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Exhaust if multiple continuing</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Always skip to next mark</i>&rdquo; &mdash; violate the voter's intent.</li>

<li>Allows a voter to <b>mark any oval</b> for each candidate <b>without</b> causing any <i>skipping</i> or <i>exhausting</i> during the counting.</li>

<li>Portland (Oregon) would have chosen this better overvote rule when we adopted ranked choice voting for our mayoral and city-council elections, and we are likely to switch to this better overvote rule after it becomes available.&nbsp; (This adoption is likely to be delayed by the cost of re-educating voters, and the cost of upgrading the contract with the election-system vendor.)</li>

<li>Other cities and states that adopt ranked choice voting will <b>save money on voter education</b> because teaching voters to avoid overvotes will become much less important!</li>

<li>Allows a voter to rank their <b>most-disliked</b> candidate below all other candidates, even when there are more candidates than <i>rank</i> columns.&nbsp; This advantage would have been especially useful in the 2024 Portland (Oregon) mayoral election because the two biggest-money-backed candidates were strongly disliked.&nbsp; Many voters would have liked to rank their most-disliked candidate at <i>rank</i> 6, rank their next-most-disliked candidate at <i>rank</i> 5, and rank numerous other candidates in <i>ranks</i> 1 through 4.&nbsp; Yet if any voter did this, their ballot could have counted as support for one of their two most-disliked candidates in opposition to a higher-ranked candidate.</li>

<li>A ballot is never counted for a voter's clearly disliked candidate instead of another continuing candidate who the voter has clearly ranked higher.</li>

<li>Oregon's 2024 ballot measure 117, which would have adopted ranked choice voting for some Oregon elections (if it had passed), omitted any mention of &ldquo;overvotes&rdquo; (or how to count them) so a better overvote rule (such as this one) could be adopted when it became available (without needing to revise the counting rules).&nbsp; This high-profile legal wording reveals that <b>lots of election experts in Oregon</b> want this better overvote rule.</li>

<li>The existing option named &ldquo;<i>Always skip to next mark</i>&rdquo; too easily counts the ballot for candidates who are ranked lower than the overvoted candidates, even while one or more of the higher-ranked overvoted candidates are still continuing.</li>

<li>The existing options &ldquo;<i>Exhaust immediately</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Exhaust if multiple continuing</i>&rdquo; dismiss all the remaining voter's marks instead of waiting for eliminations that might cause an overvoted column to become a mark for just one candidate.</li>

<li>Overcomes one of the two biggest criticisms of ranked choice voting, which is that ranked-choice ballots are difficult to learn how to mark.</li>

</li>

<p>If anyone still thinks existing overvote rules are adequate, please look at the webpage here &mdash; <a href="https://votefair.org/ballot_marking_advice.html">https://votefair.org/ballot_marking_advice.html</a> &mdash; which I created to explain to Portland voters how to mark ballots in the 2024 Portland mayoral and city-council elections (which both used ranked choice voting).&nbsp; It clarifies why simple advice such as &ldquo;<i>don't mark the ones you don't like</i>&rdquo; isn't helpful when there are lots of candidates, including some who are strongly disliked.</p>



<h2>Simple descriptive example</h2>


<p>Here's a simple scenario that explains how this overvote rule works.</p>

<p>Clarification:&nbsp; This description, and this entire document, refers to a voter marking ovals in <i>rank</i> columns.&nbsp; This convention applies to elections in the United States.&nbsp; In Australia a voter writes a number in the empty box next to each candidate's name, so in that case an overvote occurs when the voter uses the same number more than once.</p>

<ul>

<li>Assume a ballot ranks candidates C and D in the same <i>rank</i> column.</li>

<li>Assume the candidates ranked higher than candidates C and D have been eliminated.</li>

<li>For each counting round in which candidate <b>C</b> is <i><b>continuing</b></i> (not yet eliminated), and candidate <b>D</b> has been <b>eliminated</b>, count the ballot for candidate <b>C</b>.</li>

<li>For each counting round in which candidate <b>C</b> has been <b>eliminated</b>, and candidate <b>D</b> is <i><b>continuing</b></i>, count the ballot for candidate <b>D</b>.</li>

<li>For each counting round in which <b>both</b> C and D are <b>continuing</b>, count this ballot as <b>temporarily inactive</b>, in the category <i>Inactive Ballot by Overvote</i>.</li>

<li>For each counting round in which <b>both</b> candidates C and D have been <b>eliminated</b>, use the ranking information for the candidates who are ranked lower than candidates C and D.</li>

</li>



<h2>About the &ldquo;<i>Test Deck</i>&rdquo; Ballot Data</h2>

<p>The sample ballots specified below come from the following document written by the Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center (RCVRC).</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJdGmyVVqXwja6oRQ6DHN2ttMQ1ehUMzcftLyQKTWpo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJdGmyVVqXwja6oRQ6DHN2ttMQ1ehUMzcftLyQKTWpo/edit</a></p>

<p>The notation used here is:<br />
A, B, C, D are candidates<br/>
CW is a declared and certified write-in candidate (whose name must be written)<br/>
&ldquo;>&rdquo; means &ldquo;is ranked above&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;=&rdquo; means &ldquo;is ranked the same as&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Detailed Example, Fourth Counting Round</h2>

<p>ballot 1: A>B<br />

ballot 15: A=B&nbsp; (now exhausted)<br />
ballot 16: A>B<br />
ballot 17: A=B&nbsp; (undervote)<br />
ballot 20: A=B&nbsp; (inactive, has current overvote A=B)<br />
ballot 21: A>B&nbsp; (active, no longer has overvote)<br />
ballot 22: B>A</p>

<p>9 votes for candidate <b>A</b>&nbsp; (includes ballot 21)<br />
7 votes for candidate <b>B</b><br />
<b>Active vote count</b> is 16</p>

<p><b>1 Inactive Ballot by Overvote</b>:&nbsp; ballot 20 which <b>ranks both A and B as first choice</b><br />
<b>2 Inactive Ballots by Exhausted Choices</b>:&nbsp; ballots 14 and 15<br />
1 Undervote:&nbsp; ballot 17<br />
Total vote count is 20</p>

<p>Candidate <b>A wins</b> because candidate A has more than half the number of active votes.&nbsp; Also because candidate A is the only remaining candidate after eliminating candidate B which has the fewest votes.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Here are reminders why adding this overvote rule, <i><b>Temporarily Inactive When Multiple Continuing</b></i>, to the RCTab software is so important.</p>

<ul>

<li>It will save lots of money otherwise <b>wasted</b> on voter education trying to teach voters to resist the urge to simply and clearly indicate their actual preferences.</li>

<li>The lack of a primary election in Portland revealed increased <b>frustration</b> for marking a ranked choice ballot when it has only six <i>rank</i> columns, involves more than 10 candidates, has one or two front-runner candidates who are strongly disliked, and uses an existing overvote rule that easily betrays the voter's clear intent.</li>

<li>Most importantly, this <b>simple</b> overvote rule will reduce voter confusion and <b>speed up adoption</b> of ranked choice voting!</li>

</ul>
