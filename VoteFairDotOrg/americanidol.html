<h2>Thank you for your past participation!</h2>

<p>The VoteFair American Idol polls have come to an end. Why?</p>

<ul>

<li>I, the administrator of these polls, am now focused on a new website at:
<a href="https://www.NewsHereNow.com">www.NewsHereNow.com</a>&nbsp;
It's free and anonymous,
and it will bring economic prosperity to your neighborhood,
so please check it out and then tell your social-media contacts about it.</li>

<li>Participation in these polls has dropped dramatically now that most of us watch TV as streaming videos,
rather than as "live" (or "live on tape" for the West Coast) TV broadcasts.</li>

<li>The show has abandoned the remaining viewers on the West Coast by not offering us a chance to vote during prime-time hours.</li>

</ul>

<p>To all of you who have participated in these polls,
<b>thank you!</b></p>

<p>Now it's time to focus on the vote-splitting unfairness that is headed our way,
namely the 2020 Democratic presidential primary election.
We saw that the winner of the 2016 Republican presidential primary
was a candidate who would not have won if there had not been vote splitting among the 15 other candidates.
Let's use what we've learned and put an end to the unfairness of vote splitting in U.S. elections.</p>

<h1>Cross-season poll, Seasons 1 through 16</h1>

<p>Final results for the cross-season poll for seasons 1 through 16:</p>

<p>Based on 40 ballots, here are the popularity rankings for singers: The most popular singer is Kelly Clarkson (season 1).    The second-most popular singer is Maddie Poppe (season 16).    The third-most popular singer is Carrie Underwood (season 4).    The fourth-most popular singer is Haley Reinhart (season 10).    The fifth-most popular singer is a tie between Jennifer Hudson (season 3) and Adam Lambert (season 8).    The sixth-most popular singer is Michael J. Woodard (season 16).    The seventh-most popular singer is Caleb Lee Hutchinson (season 16).    The eighth-most popular singer is David Cook (season 7).    The ninth-most popular singer is Candice Glover (season 12).    The tenth-most popular singer is Trent Harmon (season 15).    The eleventh-most popular singer is LaPorsha Renae (season 15).    ••••     For comparison purposes, here are the traditional (single-mark) vote counts converted into percentages: Kelly Clarkson (season 1) at 25%, Maddie Poppe (season 16) at 30%, Carrie Underwood (season 4) at 8%, Haley Reinhart (season 10) at 8%, Jennifer Hudson (season 3) at 3%, Adam Lambert (season 8) at 5%, Michael J. Woodard (season 16) at 8%, Caleb Lee Hutchinson (season 16) at 0%, David Cook (season 7) at 8%, Candice Glover (season 12) at 3%, Trent Harmon (season 15) at 0%, LaPorsha Renae (season 15) at 0%.)</p>

<p>If your favorite singer is not in this poll,
it's because that singer
did not rank high enough in earlier polls.
In particular, shortly after they won,
Chris Daughtry and Phillip Phillips
did not do well in these polls.</p>

<p>The ballot has room for only 12 choices.&nbsp;
LaPorsha Renae from season 15 was just popular enough
to justify remaining in this cross-season poll,
which left three spots open for this season's most-popular singers.</p>

<p>Note that Michael J. Woodard is in the poll, and Gabby Barrett is not in the poll.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp;
Because in earlier weeks Michael was consistently ranked as more popular than Gabby.&nbsp;
Specifically this means that the fans whose first choice was
Maddie, Caleb, Catie, Jurnee, Cade, Dennis, etc.
more often ranked Michael above Gabby (compared to ranking Gabby above Michael).&nbsp;

please scroll down to the following heading:

<a name="SEASON16"></a>

<h1>Season 16 poll</h1>

<h2>Final results, top 3</h2>

<p>Congratulations Maddie!
Based on the results here,
she deserved to win.&nbsp;
With three choices, vote splitting could have happened easily.&nbsp;
Fortunately some recent developments led to the pairwise most-popular singer winning.</p>

<p>
Based on 107 ballots, after having removed ballots cast from outside the United States, here are the popularity rankings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Most popular: Maddie Poppe</li>
<li>Second-most popular: Gabby Barrett</li>
<li>Third-most popular: Caleb Lee Hutchinson</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Most popular: Ryan Seacrest</li>
<li>Second-most popular: Katy Perry</li>
<li>Third-most popular: Lionel Richie</li>
<li>Fourth-most popular: Luke Bryan</li>
</ol>

<p>For comparison purposes, here are the traditional (single-mark) vote counts converted into percentages: Maddie Poppe at 57%, Gabby Barrett at 21%, Caleb Lee Hutchinson at 19%, Ryan Seacrest at 36%, Katy Perry at 21%, Lionel Richie at 16%, Luke Bryan at 15%.</p>

<p>As a clarification, after most of the above votes were cast,
social media focused attention on comments from Gabby, and about Gabby,
regarding her personality when the cameras were not on her.
Those shifts, plus flawed performances at the finale,
and a "single" that got lots of dislikes,
account for why she ended up in third place
in spite of here (before those events) being ranked as second-most popular.</p>

<p>As another clarification, in the finale,
Caleb started the show with a significant mistake
(starting too early, stopping, then starting again),
and that probably reduced his vote count compared to what would have happened
if he had not made that mistake.</p>

<p>In contrast, in the finale, Maddie did not make any apparent mistakes.</p>

<h2>VoteFair prediction: Least-popular Caleb will win</h2>

<p>Currently Caleb is the least-popular singer in the VoteFair American Idol poll,
yet Caleb is likely to win.  Here are the most important reasons why he is likely to win:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of heavy voting is done by long-time American Idol fans who are now (roughly)
middle-aged women who prefer a male winner.</li>

<li>Caleb will get lots of votes from country-western music fans who network
with each other and remind each other to vote,
even though most country-western-music fans do not watch the show.
(Yes, Gabby might somewhat benefit from this effect, but probably not enough to win.)</li>

<li>Fans who prefer a female winner will be splitting their votes
between Maddie and Gabby.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's focus on the third reason because the first two reasons have been covered
in previous VoteFair commentary postings.</p>

<p>Voting in the "finale" round is different from previous voting rounds. Why?
Because at this point most fans of American Idol vote for just one singer,
and they give zero, or near-zero, votes to their second-favorite singer.
This is a shift from previous weeks when the focus was on whether the voter
approves or disapproves of each singer.</p>

<p>Of course we never know what the official vote counts are,
yet it's easy to imagine that the official vote counts will look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Caleb: 35 percent</li>
<li>Gabby: 33 percent</li>
<li>Maddie: 32 percent</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that this would mean 65 percent of the voters would prefer a female to win,
yet their votes are split between the two remaining female singers.
(These numbers assume that voters do not give any votes to their second choice.)
In other words, "vote splitting" is a strong effect in the final week's voting.</p>

<p>If you don't already know about "vote splitting," please look it up in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting">Wikipedia</a>.
<!--
(The specific link is not used here because two "bots" would automatically intrude on this thread.)
-->
It's important to understand vote splitting
because it accounts for the surprise result in the
2016 Republican presidential primary election.
In that case, where there were 17 candidates,
vote splitting among the 16 non-winning candidates made it easy for the winning
candidate to get more votes than any one of the other candidates.</p>

<p>In theory, American Idol's use of "score voting" allows voters to
avoid vote splitting &mdash; but only if voters are willing to give some votes
to a voter's second-favorite choice.
Yet even I, who clearly understand the mathematics behind vote splitting,
will find it difficult to give too many votes to my second choice
in this American Idol contest, where an unfair outcome won't hurt me.
Politics is different because those outcomes can hurt me.</p>

<p>Fortunately, regardless of who wins this year,
all three singers will become very successful musicians,
limited only by the effort they put into their music careers
&mdash; and, for the winner, limited by the oppressive American Idol contract.</p>

<h2>Michael's elimination demonstrates pairwise popularity versus single-mark "popularity"</h2>

<p>If you were saddened by Michael's elimination from American Idol,
you will appreciate understanding why the elimination happened.
Significantly the same explanation also explains
the surprise result of the 2016 Republican presidential primary election.</p>

<p>In the VoteFair American Idol poll, where 80 people fully ranked all the singers,
Michael was second-most popular. That implies he should have made it into the top 3.</p>

<p>However, if we only consider the first-most favorite singer of those 80 people,
we see that Michael was the first choice of only 23 percent, which is close to
the 21 percent for Gabby, and not comfortably far from the 13 percent for Caleb.
(For "give-me-the-data" readers, Maddie got 31 percent, and Cade got 8 percent.)</p> 

<p>Understanding what this means involves understanding "pairwise" comparisons.
Specifically, if fans were asked "Do you prefer Michael or Gabby more?" it's likely that
more than half the fans would say Michael.
However, these people include lots of people who prefer Maddie or Caleb or Cade
as their first choice.</p>

<p>These pairwise comparisons are done automatically in your mind when you rank
all the choices from most popular to least popular.  In other words, if you rank the singers
as first, Maddie, second, Michael, third, Gabby, fourth, Caleb, and fifth, Cade, then
you have revealed that you prefer Michael over Gabby, Michael over Caleb, Michael over
Cade, Gabby over Caleb, Gabby over Cade, Caleb over Cade,
and (for brevity) Maddie over each of the other singers.  All this extra information
is supplied to the VoteFair ranking software, and that's partly why the VoteFair results
are so much more meaningful than only asking for a voter's first choice.</p>

<p>To further understand pairwise comparisons, consider the
2016 Republican presidential primary election.
It involved 17 candidates!
In this situation if we only consider each voter's first choice (which is officially what we did),
then it's not too difficult for one candidate to get more of these first-choice-only votes
compared to each of the other candidates.
That's all it took to win that contest.
But if voters had been able to fully rank all the candidates,
then pairwise comparisons could have been done,
and those pairwise comparisons would have correctly revealed who was actually most popular.
What we do know from the single-mark ballots (taking into account that the non-winning candidates
would have gotten more votes if they had not dropped out before the election was over)
is that roughly around 70 percent of the Republican(!) voters wanted someone other than the winner.</p>

<p>Hopefully you now understand that if each person voting only marks
a single choice, the numbers do not really reveal actual popularity.
Yet in politics and in American Idol voting we do not count votes
correctly, in ways that reveal true popularity.</p>

<p>This is why winners and losers in primitive-method voting contests are not necessarily
the most popular or least popular.
Specifically, the person who gets the most single-mark votes is not necessarily the most popular,
and the person who gets the fewest single-mark votes is not necessarily the least popular.
For fair results, we need to look deeper, beneath the first-choice-only votes.</p>

<h2>Top 5 final results</h2>

<p>Based on 80 ballots, here are the popularity rankings for singers: The most popular singer is Maddie Poppe.    The second-most popular singer is Michael J. Woodard.    The third-most popular singer is Gabby Barrett.    The fourth-most popular singer is Caleb Lee Hutchinson.    The fifth-most popular singer is Cade Foehner.    ••••     Based on 80 ballots, here are the popularity rankings for judges/host: The most popular judge/host is Ryan Seacrest.    The second-most popular judge/host is Luke Bryan.    The third-most popular judge/host is a tie between Lionel Richie and Katy Perry.    ••••     For comparison purposes, here are the traditional (single-mark) vote counts converted into percentages: Maddie Poppe at 31%, Michael J. Woodard at 23%, Gabby Barrett at 21%, Caleb Lee Hutchinson at 13%, Cade Foehner at 8%, Ryan Seacrest at 31%, Luke Bryan at 23%, Lionel Richie at 10%, Katy Perry at 24%.</p>

<h2>Now on Reddit</h2>

<p>I now participate in the "americanidol" subreddit within Reddit.com
&mdash; under the username CPsolver &mdash;
so if you have any voting-related questions,
please reply to one of my latest (about two per week) posts there.</p>

<h2>From top 7 to top 5, commentary including power-voting insights</h2>

<p>Catie's double mistake &mdash; of forgetting song lyrics and letting that mistake
affect the rest of her performance and on-stage time &mdash; easily justified her elimination.&nbsp;
Unfortunately the need for most of us to vote during the earlier part of the show
meant that we couldn't easily reduce our vote count for her.&nbsp;
Fortunately the official vote counters apparently know enough to not blindly use the "official"
vote counts, and instead also take into account what was presumably the trend of withdrawing votes
from Catie following her double mistake.&nbsp;
If you were a fan of hers, you can look forward to seeing more of her because she will get lots
of jobs in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;
For reference, up until her blooper moment, Catie was third-most popular in the
VoteFair American Idol poll.</p>

<p>Finally, this week, the sound levels were controlled by a competent sound engineer.&nbsp;
This improvement allowed us to clearly hear the singers &mdash;
and clearly hear Catie's mistake.&nbsp;
In prior weeks the sound levels were so bad that some people thought the performers might be
lip-synching to a studio-recorded version.</p>

<p>Jurnee's elimination was no surprise.&nbsp;
In the VoteFair poll she was ranked at the bottom (in the final results)
or near the bottom (earlier in the week).&nbsp;
Her elimination demonstrates why the judges keep reminding the contestants
to connect with the audience.</p>

<p>Cade has been at or near the bottom of the VoteFair poll, so why was he not elimnated?&nbsp;
And Caleb has been near the bottom of the VoteFair poll, so why was he not eliminated?&nbsp;
This brings us to the concept of "power voting."</p>

<p>In the earlier years of American Idol, lots and lots of women around the age of 30 to 40 (roughly)
dominated the official voting by non-stop dialing phone votes
(which back then involved hearing the contestant's voice say "thank you" for each vote).&nbsp;
When text-message voting was added, many of these women spent time or money texting votes
in ways that amplified their influence.&nbsp;
That's why good-looking white males often won the contest.&nbsp;
Now that each phone number is limited to just 10 votes (per contestant),
presumably many of these women vote for Cade and Caleb using multiple email accounts.</p>

<p>For anyone who might not know, it's easy for someone to have lots of different email accounts.&nbsp;
At the basic level, a person can get one or more Gmail accounts and one or more Yahoo accounts
and also use their ISP (internet-service-provider) email account.&nbsp;
Plus they can use one or more Facebook accounts.&nbsp;
The voting rules allow each of these email addresses and identities to be used with
both the American Idol app and the American Idol website,
which doubles the influence of anyone who takes the time to do such power voting.&nbsp;
That's why simply counting Facebook and Instagram (which is owned by Facebook)
followers does not indicate much about official vote counts.</p>

<p>The other "power voting" method is to recruit other people to vote for your favorite.&nbsp;
This is why Country-Western music singers, such as Caleb (and perhaps wannabe Gabby),
get lots and lots of official votes, yet don't have a correspondingly high number of
social-media followers, and don't get high votes in the VoteFair poll.&nbsp;
Specifically some Country-Western music fans watch American Idol and then, either online
or at CW music events, tell other CW music fans to "text the number whatever to line whatever
on Sunday night between 5 and 6 o'clock."&nbsp;
This is yet another reason that counting each contestant's fans online
does not reveal the official vote counts.</p>

<p>Some people think that power voting is "unfair," but remember that the goal is not to
identify who is the best singer.&nbsp;
Instead the show's goal is to identify who can fill the most seats in a concert tour,
which in turn reveals who can best promote other money-based activities &mdash;
such as taking a trip to Disneyland or Disney World.</p>

<p>Finally we arrive at an insight about which three contestants would be "best" in the finale
from the perspective of the people running the show.&nbsp;
In my opinion the "producers" (using the term loosly) would like
Maddie and Gabby and Caleb to be in the top three.</p>

<p>Before you get upset about Michael perhaps "losing out" in spite of being the best musical artist,
consider that he will have a fabulous musical career, and it will be better off without
being under the thumb of people who want to mold him to become basically another Disney character.&nbsp;
To put this into perspective, I bought Kelly Clarkson's first music album
and I was disappointed by the
producers "sweetening" the background music and drowning out her voice;
she sounded much better during the live shows.</p>

<p>And before you get upset about the possiblity of Cade not being in the top three,
consider that he prefers rock music and Disney corporation (which owns ABC)
caters to a clearly non-rock-music demographic.&nbsp;
(Personally rock music is my favorite genre, so I very much like his music.)&nbsp;
Also, based on something I read online (which means it may not be true,
yet it seems to fit his personality), Cade is not necessarily committed to a career in music.&nbsp;
That would defeat the point of the show, which is to create a music star.</p>

<p>The Disney corporation would be happiest if either Maddie or Gabby won because they could
dress her up like they do with Katy Perry.&nbsp; If Caleb won, they would also be happy
because he can be portrayed as the kind of "good" boy they like to feature in their movies.&nbsp;
And that leaves Michael free to be the great musical artist he is likely to become,
and it leaves Cade free to do whatever he wants with his notoriety and "good looks."&nbsp;
And now Catie is free to become a famous TV celebrity or whatever she wants to do with her
excellent ability to connect with audiences who like her quirkiness.</p>

<h2>Final results for the top-7 VoteFair poll</h2>

<p>Based on 98 ballots, here are the popularity rankings for the top-7 week:<br />The most popular singer is Maddie Poppe.<br />The second-most popular singer is Michael J. Woodard.<br />The third-most popular singer is Catie Turner.<br />The fourth-most popular singer is Gabby Barrett.<br />The fifth-most popular singer is Caleb Lee Hutchinson.<br />The sixth-most popular singer is Cade Foehner.<br />The seventh-most popular singer is Jurnee.</p>

<h2>From top 10 to top 7: Pulling winners from the wreckage</h2>

<p>Ryan Seacrest's announcement about a "difference of point one nine percent" (if I recall the number correctly)
reveals that all the different voting methods were fully saturated!&nbsp;
(The fact that all the voting happened in just two hours
easily accounts for the fully saturated voting connections.)&nbsp;
This means that just looking at the raw numbers would have revealed very unfair results.&nbsp;
Apparently the official vote counters analyzed the data at a deeper level,
because that was necessary to correctly identify
the separation between who should stay and who cannot possibly win.</p>

<p>If the previous week's announcement that the show would be "live in all time zones"
had been worded more clearly to indicate that viewers on the west coast needed to watch
at a time 3 hours earlier, the vote-counting computers would have been even more saturated.&nbsp;
For clarification to people who do not live on the west coast,
countless TV shows claim to be "live" but, for us on the west coast,
that just means it's recorded in front of a live audience,
profanity is bleeped out, and then the show is broadcast 3 hours after the "live-live"
version on the east coast.&nbsp;
As a result of the scriptwriter's mistake,
countless fans (including me) on the west coast discovered that
voting and eliminations had already been done when we watched it from 8pm to 10pm,
it's usual time (on both coasts).&nbsp;
This loss of voting data easily could have affected the results,
such as giving fewer votes to country-western singer Caleb.</p>

<p>Some people question whether Caleb deserves to be in the top 7.&nbsp;
Based on the poll results here, he doesn't.&nbsp;
But this pattern happens each season because country-western music fans
are well-networked and they tell each other when to vote and what number to use for text-message voting,
based on information that comes from the fewer number of country-western-music fans who watch the show.</p>

<p>Some people question why Cade was not eliminated.&nbsp;
In case you don't know why, lots and lots of American Idol fans
started watching when they were young mothers, around 30 to 40 years of age (roughly),
and they are biased in favor of good-looking (to them) young men.&nbsp;
This gives an advantage to Cade and Caleb.</p>

<p>Some people question whether Jurnee should have been eliminated insead of Gabby.&nbsp;
Maybe.&nbsp; Yet more importantly it's likely that Jurnee will be eliminated next week,
and if the outcome had been reversed then Gabby would be the one going home next week.&nbsp;
In other words, the cutoff between "can win" and "can't win" always involves some
lack of precision about the exact dividing point.</p>

<p>So, thankfully, the transition from top 10 to top 7 was as fair as it could have been,
considering the potential for disaster.</p>

<p>Now let's hope the show hires a second sound engineer, because we really do want to hear
the contestants sing, and we really need to hear what Ryan announces.</p>

<h2>Final results for the top-10 VoteFair poll</h2>

<p>Based on 125 ballots, here are the final VoteFair popularity rankings for the top-10 week:<br />The most popular singer is Maddie Poppe.<br />The second-most popular singer is Michael J. Woodard.<br />The third-most popular singer is Catie Turner.<br />The fourth-most popular singer is Jurnee.<br />The fifth-most popular singer is Gabby Barrett.<br />The sixth-most popular singer is Caleb Lee Hutchinson.<br />The seventh-most popular singer is Cade Foehner.<br />The eighth-most popular singer is Dennis Lorenzo.<br />The ninth-most popular singer is Ada Vox.<br />The tenth-most popular singer is Michelle Sussett.</p>

<h2>What's the best strategy for official voting?</h2>

<p>To maximize your influence in the American Idol official voting, you should give the maximum of 10 votes to your favorite 3, 4, or 5 contestants, and you should give zero votes to all the other contestants.</p>

<p>Explanation: The official voting uses "score voting" and the well-known best strategy for this kind of voting is to give the highest score to the choices you "approve" and to give the lowest score to the choices you "disapprove."</p>

<p>The tricky part is deciding which score -- the highest or lowest -- you should give to singers who you like, but who you do not like as much as your favorites.  The best approach becomes clearer by understanding why the all-or-nothing "approval" strategy works.</p>

<p>Suppose you are tempted, perhaps out of guilt, to give at least one vote to every singer.  That would yield the same influence as giving a score of 9 (out of 10) to your favorite singers and giving zero to the other singers.</p>

<p>In other words, your voting influence is really the difference between a high score for a favorite and a low score for someone you dislike.  With this in mind, the biggest difference happens when you use the highest and lowest scores.</p>

<p>Another way to understand this concept is to consider that if you vote using text messaging, you wouldn't send 10 texts to support your favorite singer and then send one text each to support each of the other singers.</p>

<p>Of course if you cast multiple ballots -- such as one ballot using American Idol's voting app and another ballot using the American Idol website -- then you get the most influence by voting the same way on each ballot.</p>

<h2>Top 10 week</h2>

<p>The VoteFair American Idol poll, Top 10, is now open!</p>

<p>Temporarily you need to do two extra clicks,
where you will see the words "American Idol 2018, Top 10"
and "I Want To Vote In This Poll" (until some new code has been debugged).&nbsp;
Thank you for your patience as you access the brand-new NewsHereNow website/webapp!</p>


<h2>Top 14 week</h2>

<p>Oops, the process of debugging some new code delayed the opening of the season 16 poll. I apologize for the delay.</p>

<h1>Season 15 poll</h1>

<h2>Top 2 results</h2>

<p>It's a wrap!&nbsp;
This season was much fairer than what has happened in some other seasons,
and with a final pairwise contest between the two most popular singers,
we have a deserving winner.&nbsp;
Congratulations
<b>Trent Harmon</b>!</p>

<p>To those of you who have been voting in these VoteFair polls, <b>thank you</b>!!!</b>

<h2>Top 3 results</h2>

<p>No surprise this week.&nbsp; Now we are down to a pairwise comparison between the two top singers.&nbsp;
In a pairwise comparison, vote splitting cannot happen.</p>

<p>Each week in these VoteFair polls your ranking of contestants makes it possible to do pairwise comparisons,
and that's why the results here are not vulnerable to vote splitting.&nbsp;
In other words, vote splitting can only happen when voting only allows us to indicate a single favorite choice.</p>

<p>As a clarification, the official voting does allow us to split our support into various numbers of votes to second and third (etc.)
singers, but that is still using single-mark ballots because each such &ldquo;vote&rdquo; is a different ballot with just a single
singer's name being marked.</p>

<h2>Top 4 results</h2>

<p>No surprises this week.&nbsp; The fact that
<b>LaPorsha Renae</b>
was in the bottom two reveals that,
in the official voting,
fans who prefer a male singer significantly outnumber fans who prefer a female singer.&nbsp;
This means that fans of the two remaining male singers might cast so many votes that
<b>LaPorsha Renae</b>
could be eliminated next week, even though she is more popular than third-most-popular
<b>Dalton Rapattoni</b>.</p>

<p>Expressed another way, in this VoteFair poll the fans of both male singers can indicate that
<b>LaPorsha Renae</b>
is their second choice,
but in the official voting those male-singer fans cannot afford to waste any of their official votes on her.&nbsp;
Here is yet another example of the difference between pairwise counting and first-choice only counting.
</p>

<h2>Gender-biased stuffed ballots</h2>

<p>A few voters in 
Denham Springs Louisiana,
Woodstock Georgia,
Frisco Texas,
Honolulu Hawaii,
and
Angola Indiana
have attempted to stuff the VoteFair ballot box
with their highest support for
<b>Trent Harmon</b>
and
<b>Dalton Rapattoni</b>,
and with low rankings for
<b>LaPorsha Renae</b>.&nbsp;
After removing those ballots, plus some outside-the-United-States ballots,
here (below) are the current rankings.

<p>Normally vote splitting among the three males would keep <b>LaPorsha Renae</b> relatively safe, but there is heavy official voting
by female fans who strongly prefer a good-looking male singer, and they are likely to vote using multiple accounts (such as both Facebook and Google),
so <b>LaPorsha Renae</b> is not safe.&nbsp;
As stated here in previous weeks, every vote counts &mdash; just as it does in close government elections when the differences are significant.</p>


<h2>Top 5 results</h2>

<p>The elimination of <b>Sonika Vaid</b> leaves us with three male singers and one superb female singer.&nbsp;
Next week, if nothing goes wrong with the official vote counting, vote splitting among the males combined with
the superb singing skill of <b>LaPorsha Renae</b> will cause one of the three remaining males to be eliminated.&nbsp;
This assumes that too many viewers do not assume that <b>LaPorsha Renae</b> is getting plenty of votes from other viewers.</p>

<h2>Top 6 results</h2>

<p>The fact that <b>Sonika Vaid</b> was in the bottom two &mdash; instead of slightly less-popular <b>MacKenzie Bourg</b> &mdash; indicates the typical bias
in favor of male singers.</p>

<h2>Top 6 commentary</h2>

<p>This week's current VoteFair results (Wednesday night) indicate that
<b>Tristan McIntosh</b> and/or <b>MacKenzie Bourg</b>
will be eliminated this week.</p>

<p>If any of the other singers gets the fewest official votes, then the judges should save that singer.</p>

<p>The biggest risk is that lots of fans might assume that
<b>LaPorsha Renae</b>
is getting plenty of votes from other voters,
and that could cause her to get the fewest votes.&nbsp;
This would be similar to what happened years ago the week that 
<b>Jennifer Hudson</b>
was eliminated early in the competition.</p>

<p>Please remember this lesson when you vote in the U.S. Presidential election:
don't assume that other voters will make the right choice!&nbsp; Every vote does count!</p>

<h2>Top 8 commentary</h2>

<p>No big surprises this week.</p>

<p>This week's &ldquo;greediest voter&rdquo; award goes to a voter in South Hadley, Massachusetts, who attempted to cast 10 ballots.&nbsp; Apparently he or she does not realize that just using a different ranking on each ballot does not make them come from different places.</p>

<h2>Top 10 results, and what's happening in the U.S. Presidential primary election</h2>

<p>Yup, vote-splitting happened this week.&nbsp; And with vote-splitting going on in the U.S. Presidential election among the Republican candidates, it's a good time to remind you how it works.</p>

<p>Among the Top 10 there were 6 females and 4 males.&nbsp; If we guess that the preference for a male winner versus a female winner is somewhat equal,
then the half of the voters who prefer a female are splitting their votes among 6 contestants, whereas the half of the voters who prefer a male are only splitting their votes among 4 contestants.&nbsp; The result is that each female gets fewer votes compared to each male, which makes the elimination of two female singers more likely compared to the non-gender-biased result of eliminating one male and one female.</p>

<p>Again the important concept is that <b>the contestant with the fewest first-choice votes is not necessarily the least-popular contestant</b>.</p>

<p>In this case, <b>Olivia Rox</b>, in the VoteFair poll, was not the second-least-popular singer, but the least-popular male singer, <b>Lee Jean</b>, received more first-choice votes.&nbsp; And apparently either she did not sing as well as usual, or <b>Tristan McIntosh</b> and <b>Avalon Young</b> sang better than usual (I don't know which because I don't watch on Thursday nights), so <b>Olivia Rox</b> was eliminated early.</p>

<p>[Clarification from Mrs. Dale Wester: &ldquo;Olivia had to be hospitalized for the flu during Top 10 week; I doubt she was fully recovered last Thursday. This week, her biggest problem was song choice. In exit interviews, Olivia explained that she had a different song prepared but changed based on recommendations given during rehearsals.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>The elimination of <b>Gianna Isabella</b> was fair, because she was at the bottom of the Top 10.</p>

<p>In the Republican presidential election, the presence of three main candidates is causing vote splitting because each voter can only mark the name of one candidate.&nbsp; If instead each voter could indicate a second choice, <b>pairwise counting</b> could be done, and pairwise counting is not vulnerable to vote splitting.&nbsp; What does this really mean?</p>

<p>The writers of the U.S. Constitution knew about vote splitting, so they set up the <b>electoral college</b> voting method.&nbsp; At the time, without having even mechanical devices that could do sophisticated counting, that's the best they could do.&nbsp; Yet the founders of our nation would be dumbfounded by the stupidity of today's Congress.&nbsp; The founders expected that when better counting methods became practical &mdash; which they are now, because of computer technology &mdash; the members of Congress would update the Constitution to use better counting methods.&nbsp; Alas.</p>

<p>This summer many voters will see in action the process of <b>delegate voting</b> that has mostly remained unchanged since the early days of our nation.&nbsp; At the Republican convention there will be a first round of voting, and in that first round, none of the Republican candidates will receive a majority of votes &mdash; from the &ldquo;delegates&rdquo; who are supposed to represent us, the actual voters.&nbsp; Besides the unfairness that the delegates are insiders who get chosen as a reward for having done political favors, the bigger unfairness is that those delegates have no idea who the voters really prefer the most, overall.&nbsp; Why do they not know?&nbsp; We, the voters, or at least the &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; voters, were never asked for our second choice.&nbsp; (Of course a second choice is not needed for the Democratic convention.)&nbsp; The long-standing tradition is to <i>assume</i> that the delegates are smart people, and that the delegates who promised to vote (on the first round) for their candidate will, when necessary, shift their vote to the best of the remaining candidates.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; What really happens is that in back-room meetings delegates (and the unpopular candidates who only have a few delegates) are promised something they want in exchange for switching their vote, usually to the candidate who the party insiders prefer.&nbsp; And that person would be Marco Rubio, because he is a puppet of special interests.&nbsp; This does not mean that Marco Rubio will win.&nbsp; It means that Republican insiders will try to use the convention's vote-shifting process to defeat Donald Trump because his political views are unknown (and have changed dramatically over time).&nbsp; To a lessor extent, insiders will also try to defeat Ted Cruz because he is motivated by some personal prejudices that are in conflict with party &ldquo;traditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What can be done?&nbsp; Learn more!&nbsp; And please point out to family members and close friends that marking only a single candidate's name on an election ballot is primitive!&nbsp; For a clear explanation of the problem and the solution, please read the <a href="http://www.bansinglemarkballots.com"><i>Declaration of Election-Method Reform Advocates</i></a>, which is a document signed by a few of us who fully understand vote-counting methods.&nbsp; Thank you for learning!&nbsp; For that you are a hero!</p>


<h2>Top 10 poll</h2>

<p>Now that we can fit both the males and females into the same poll, we can compare the popularity of the males versus females.&nbsp; But remember that the show uses unfair <i>single-mark balloting</i>, so don't assume that the elimination order will be gender unbiased.&nbsp; In fact, a female is likely to be eliminated next, even if she is a better singer than all the males, simply because currently there are fewer males.&nbsp; The pairwise counting done in these VoteFair polls do not have that <i>vote-splitting</i> unfairness.</p>

<p>A few people voted in the Top 24 poll after the Thursday show started on the East coast, and those votes were removed.&nbsp; (Please wait for the new poll to start.&nbsp; Sometimes I'm busy on Thursday night and cannot close the poll until later that night, and cannot start the next poll until mid-day Friday.)</p>

<h2>Top 24 commentary</h2>

<p>The judges and producers were wise to abandon their original plans to have the judges choose almost all the top 10 contestants.&nbsp; Based on the results of this last week's VoteFair poll, the judges made wise decisions when they chose the four top singers, and this prevented the unfair results that otherwise would have happened with so many contestants and so many needed eliminations.&nbsp; The producers wisely allowed us, the viewers, to choose the other six.</p>

<p>Let's hope that TV producers do not forget the most important lesson from American Idol: It is popular because we, the viewers, get to vote, without the judges getting to have <i>any</i> voting influence.&nbsp; The TV shows that allow their judges to give extra points to their favorite(s) are so much less worthwhile to watch because it takes too many viewer votes to overcome those biases from the judges.&nbsp; At this point, the judges still can influence voting by what they say, and that's plenty of influence at this point (after they eliminated thousands of less-skilled singers).</p>

<h2>Top 24 poll</h2>

<p>The Season 15 VoteFair poll is now open!&nbsp; Share your preferences in this poll, so that next week you will know who to support with your official votes.</p>

<p>Ooops!&nbsp; Thank you Mrs. Dale Wester for pointing out my mistake in thinking the eliminated contestants were eligible as wildcard contestants.&nbsp; I admit that, although I watch (or just listen to) the show on Wednesday nights, I do not watch on Thursday nights.&nbsp; So I don't know what's said on the Thursday shows.&nbsp; As a fix, I have changed the word "wildcard" to "eliminated."&nbsp; It's still interesting to see which eliminated contestants are the most popular.&nbsp; (And if the show needs to pick a replacement for someone who can't continue, the results here could provide some info about who to consider.)</p>

<a name="CROSS14SEASON"></a>
<h1>Cross-season poll, Seasons 1 through 14</h1>

<h2>Gender bias?&nbsp; Yes!</h2>

<p>This year's cross-season poll reveals a clear gender bias in favor of male contestants.&nbsp;
Ironically, in this gender bias, it is women who tend to prefer male singers,
and apparently (based on various evidence) they vote more often in the official voting,
so they tend to cause the winner to be a male.&nbsp;
In contrast to official voting, this poll limits each voter to just one ballot.</p>

<p>This two-question poll
&mdash; which admittedly is not statistically significant for many reasons &mdash;
shows that
<b>Jax Cole</b>
and
<b>Joey Cook</b>
are more popular than the winner <b>Nick Fradiani</b>,
and more popular than runner-up <b>Nick Fradiani</b>,
even though
<b>Jax Cole</b>
was eliminated one week earlier,
and
<b>Joey Cook</b>
was eliminated five weeks earlier.</p>

<p>As in previous years, 
<b>Kelly Clarkson</b>
continues to be the most popular American Idol (among both winners and non-winners),
and <b>Carrie Underwood</b> is second-most popular.&nbsp;
<b>Haley Reinhart</b> (from Season 10) continues to rank high (third) because her fans regularly vote in this cross-season poll.</p>

<p>Interestingly this year's winner,
<b>Nick Fradiani</b>,
and runner-up,
<b>Nick Fradiani</b>,
are at the bottom of the overall poll,
where they are competing with the most popular singers from previous seasons.</p>

<p>Below are the
<a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/results-59968-44417-11259-overall.html">overall final results</a>
and
<a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/results-59968-44417-11259-recentseason.html">Season-14-only results</a>
for this year's cross-season poll.</p>

(The elimination of first-ranked <b>Angie Miller</b> was not a significant surprise because

<h2>Cross-season poll, seasons 1 through 11</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/results-10816-65328-04206.html">Here is a link to this cross-season poll results</a></p>

<p>On June 6 more than half the ballots (55%) in this cross-season poll had been cast by voters who are outside the United States.&nbsp; Those ballots have been removed.&nbsp; The results did not change much.&nbsp; <b>Jessica Sanchez</b> is still in first place.&nbsp; That does not necessarily mean that she is more popular than <b>Phillip Phillips</b>; rather it means that her fans vote here more than the fans of <b>Phillip Phillips</b> vote here.</p>

<p>The asterisks (*) below indicate the very early elimination of <b>Colton Dixon</b>, and (in the preceding week) the early near-elimination (and judges' saving) of <b>Jessica Sanchez</b>.&nbsp; The numbers in parentheses indicate a different ranking based on re-calculating the results with a more-rigorous removal of non-US voters (from many countries around the world, but especially from the Philipines).</p>

<h2>Why is there no VoteFair poll for the X-Factor show?</h2>

<p>A fan of this site has asked "why is there no VoteFair poll for the X-Factor show?"&nbsp; Here is the answer:</p>

<p>For the American Idol show, the role of the VoteFair polls is to assist voters, who in turn are meaningfully helping their favorite singers.&nbsp;
Note that on American Idol the judges do not win or lose.</p>

<p>In contrast, the X-Factor show amounts to four music producers being the contestants.&nbsp;
The show calls them "judges", but they aren't.&nbsp; They control the singers.&nbsp;
And each producer/"judge" favors "his" or "her" singers.&nbsp;
That's too much intervention for the voters to feel like their votes are the only factor in determining who wins.</p>

<p>For a similar reason there are no VoteFair polls for shows in which the "judges" get to vote;
that makes it difficult for audience votes to override the judges' votes.&nbsp;
TV producers who try to replicate the success of American Idol are failing to realize that
the popularity of American Idol is due to the fact that the voters are the only people who determine who wins.</p>

<p>(The <i>So You Think You Can Dance</i> show does handle the voting reasonably fairly,
but a VoteFair poll for that show did not get enough voters here to justify offering a VoteFair poll in later seasons.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why not vote for the worst?</h2>

<p>A website visitor has asked "why not vote for the worst?" There are several reasons, including these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most voters would pretend that their most-disliked choice is the contestant who is the biggest competitor to their favorite, and they would try to "bury" that competitor in an attempt to protect their favorite.&nbsp; Even with first-choice-only voting such a strategy is unlikely to put the competitor into the bottom.&nbsp; If this kind of voting were used officially, it would lead to bigger surprises than what now occur.</li>

<li>In the VoteFair American Idol poll, anyone can start at the bottom of the ballot and mark their most-disliked choice, and work upward toward their favorite choice.&nbsp; The voting and the counting method are symmetrical.&nbsp; As for the results, usually they would come out about the same, particularly in terms of who is most popular and who is least popular.</li>

<li>Perhaps the most important reason for not voting for the worst is that it fosters hatred, which is already in excessive abundance around the globe.&nbsp; Contests are intended to be entertaining, and mean-spiritedness detracts from the enjoyment.&nbsp; Remember that enjoyment is more important than who wins and who loses.&nbsp; (Part of the reason the American Idol TV show is so popular is that it is fun to watch, and fun to talk about.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This topic brings up an interesting question.&nbsp; When you are in an audience clapping for performers, and the loudness of the clapping is being used to determine who is most popular, is it ethical to clap loudly for your favorite choice and then only pretend to clap (with very little sound) for all the other contestants? That's an ethical question for you to consider.&nbsp; Fortunately the antidote to that technique is to recognize that measuring the loudness of clapping usually does not produce fair results when there are more than two choices, just as using first-choice-only ballots (and "plurality" counting) usually does not produce fair results when there are more than two choices.</p>

<h2>Cross-season poll, Seasons 1 through 9</h2>

<p>Below are the final results
(and <a href="http://www.votefair.org/cgi-bin/votefairrank.cgi/votingid=27332-50556-04928">detailed results</a>)
for the cross-season poll (after removing multiple votes from the same voter).&nbsp;
Lee DeWyze is ranked insincerely low by the more-numerous (in this poll) Siobhan Magnus fans,
but he is not popular enough compared to Kris Allen to become the second-most-representative choice.&nbsp;
As usual, Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood are near the top.&nbsp;
The popular non-winners &mdash; Siobhan Magnus, Jennifer Hudson, and Clay Aiken &mdash;
who are (here) more popular
than their season's winner reminds us of the unfairness caused by vote splitting
&mdash; and voting irregularities.</p>

<h2>Cross-season poll for seasons 1 through 8</h2>

<p>The results of this cross-season poll (after removing duplicates) reveal that fans of <b>Clay Aiken</b> and <b>David Archuleta</b> are well-networked and telling one another to vote here.&nbsp; Each season, <b>Kelly Clarkson</b> and <b>Carrie Underwood</b> are at or near the top because they are popular among all the people who vote here, even though they don't get as many first-choice votes.</p>

<p><b>Adam Lambert</b> appears to be less popular, but the <a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/results-43200-51085-40733.html">VoteFair representative ranking results</a> reveal that he would be the most popular if the ballots from <b>Clay Aiken</b> fans were ignored.&nbsp; This also means that most <b>Clay Aiken</b> fans rank <b>Adam Lambert</b> insincerely low.</p>

<p>Overall, notice that this kind of comparison&mdash;where every ballot counts, and every voter ranks all the candidates&mdash;reveals true popularity more accurately than simply counting first-choice votes.&nbsp; (If your favorite wasn't in this poll, note that they didn't do well in previous cross-season polls.)</p>

<h2>Season 7 commentary</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/results-43012-48946-08319.html">final VoteFair poll results</a> indicated that <b>David Archuleta</b> was slightly more popular than <b>David Cook</b>, so why did <b>David Cook</b> win?</p>

<p>Having the phone lines <b>open for four hours</b> surely limited the <b>late-night and after-midnight calls from younger fans</b>.&nbsp; <b>David Archuleta</b> has more young fans than <b>David Cook</b>, so this gave an advantage to older fans, and therefore <b>David Cook</b>.&nbsp; This alone could account for the surprise result.</p>

<p>In a broader sense, the VoteFair poll cannot predict this kind of surprise because this poll does not attempt to duplicate the same conditions&mdash;especially limited hours and multiple votes&mdash;that characterize the official voting.&nbsp; These different conditions easily account for the different results.&nbsp; Also remember that this was a close race in both the official results and the VoteFair poll.&nbsp; When a race is close, anything can happen.</p>

<p><font color="red">Why was Michael Johns eliminated early?</font></p>

<p>Unlike the other seven singers (still there when he was eliminated), <b>Michael Johns</b> did not receive a <b>concentration</b> of first-choice votes from an established large fan base willing to continuously dial his phone number.&nbsp; That happened because, relatively speaking, he does not appeal to any ready-made, well-defined, and well-networked fan base.&nbsp; In contrast, keeping in mind that averages do not apply to individuals, consider that rock-music fans would tend to concentrate votes on <b>David Cook</b>, country-music fans would tend to concentrate votes on <b>Kristy Lee Cook</b>, African Americans would tend to concentrate votes on <b>Syesha Mercado</b>, female pre-teens and teens would tend to concentrate votes on <b>Jason Castro</b> and <b>David Archuleta</b>, fans of female musicians would tend to concentrate votes on <b>Brooke White</b> (as the most popular female singer), conservative adults would tend to concentrate votes on <b>David Archuleta</b> and <b>Brooke White</b>, and rebellious teenagers and vocal-quality-conscious musicians would tend to concentrate votes on <b>Carly Smithson</b>.&nbsp; Why didn't the previous week's VoteFair poll predict his early elimination?&nbsp; Because in this poll each voter votes only once, whereas the official voting allows dedicated fans to vote as many times as the phone system can handle.&nbsp; Note that vote concentration is the flip side of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting">vote splitting</a>.</p>

<a name="SEASON6"></a>

<h2>Season 6</h2>

<p>In season 6, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting">vote splitting</a> and vote concentration (which is the flip-side
of vote splitting) caused the long-running delay in eliminating Sanjaya Malakar,
and caused the slightly early elimination of Melinda Doolittle. (They are marked with asterisks in the table.)</p>

<p><b>In this VoteFair poll, Sanjaya was correctly identified
as being the least popular every week for 8 weeks</b>.&nbsp;
During that time he was designated
by the "vote for the worst" website
and radio-show host Howard Stern as "the worst", and worthy
of votes to make the show entertaining.&nbsp;
This concentration of votes is the flip-side of vote-splitting.</p>

<p>As in politics, which also uses single-mark ballots,
money is concentrated on a single candidate in each U.S. primary
election, and if necessary money is used to temporarily back a
candidate who is politically similar to the candidate who is
most disliked by the biggest sources of money.</p>

<p>There was never any chance of Sanjaya winning.&nbsp;
The strategy of <b>concentrating votes</b> in contests
where only first-choice preferences are considered
can work when there are lots of other contestants among whom
the other voters <b>split their votes</b>.&nbsp; However,
the strategy fails when there are fewer choices.</p>

<p>Melinda was eliminated before Blake Lewis because she and Jordin
split the primitive single-mark (official) votes of the voters who preferred
a female winner, while voters who preferred a male winner
concentrated their votes on the same person.&nbsp;
(If voting had been split into two-way ("pairwise") contests,
Jordin would have won over Blake, and Melinda would have won
over Blake.)&nbsp;
Nevertheless, Melinda is not as popular as a first choice,
and that's all that counts in single-mark-ballot voting.</p>

<p>The lesson?&nbsp;
<b>The person with the most (first-choice) votes is
not necessarily the most popular,
and the person with the fewest (first-choice) votes
is not necessarily the least popular</b>.</p>

<h2>Season 5 summary</h2>

<p>In season 5 there were three unfairly early eliminations. (They are marked with asterisks in the table.)</p>

<ul>

<li>Elliott Yamin: Slightly more popular than Katharine McPhee in the VoteFair poll,
but the official <i>first-choice-only</i> votes caused the vote for males to be split two ways.</li>

<li>Chris Daughtry: Eliminated one show too early because
the official (first-choice-only) votes for males were split three ways,
whereas voters who preferred a female
had their official votes concentrated on Katharine.</li>

<li>Mandisa: The person with the fewest first-choice votes
isn't necessarily the least popular.</li>

</ul>

<a name="HUDSON"></a>

<h2>The biggest surprise elimination</h2>

<p>In Season 3 <b>Jennifer Hudson</b> was eliminated
unfairly early.&nbsp; There were seven contestants
remaining.&nbsp; She and Fantasia Barrino &mdash; who was the
final winner &mdash; and LaToya London
were female, African-American, excellent singers.&nbsp; All
three of these previously popular singers ended up
in the "bottom three" that night.&nbsp; This was a
classic demonstration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting">vote splitting</a> in which
the presence of similar choices reduces the votes
for each of the similar choices.&nbsp;
(This effect was clear from looking at the VoteFair poll results for that season,
but alas that poll data is now lost.)&nbsp;
The vote-splitting effect is well-known,
but the solution &mdash; order-of-preference voting
and VoteFair ranking &mdash; is only beginning to
be recognized.</p>


<p>Remember: The person with the fewest votes
is not necessarily the least popular!</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<a name="MAROULIS"></a>

<p>As a clarification, <b>Constantine Maroulis</b> was <b>not</b>
eliminated early because of vote-splitting, but rather because of
a <b>phone-system failure</b>.&nbsp;
(A statistical analysis of the phone-call data could have
identified the time and place of the failure.&nbsp;
This analysis also could have identified
who really had the fewest first-choice votes.)</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
