Presidential Election 2020</h1>

<p></p>

<p>
(Special content written 2019-March-4 for upcoming Reddit AMA)</p>

<p>
Donald Trump is not as popular as many people believe him to be.</p>

<p>
Recall the first question at the first Republican primary-election debate.  When each candidate was asked if he (or she) would run as an independent if he failed to become the Republican nominee, Trump said yes.</p>

<p>
What was going on?  If the Republican party promoted some other favorite candidate, say Jeb Bush, to become the nominee, then Trump running as an independent candidate would have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting">split the votes</a> of conservatives.  Then the Democratic nominee (whoever that might have been) would have easily won the general election.</p>

<p>
This is why the Republican party embraces Trump, even though they don't like him, and even though they disagree with lots of things he tries to push through (such as the border wall).  A large portion of the "Republican" voters go along with that because they believe what the Republican party says.</p>

<p>
There is another reason Trump is not as popular as many believe, and it too is based on <b>vote splitting</b>.</p>

<p>
During the Republican presidential primary Trump competed against 16 other Republican candidates.  Republican voters were only allowed to mark one candidate on their primary ballot.  Before some of the candidates dropped out, Trump was getting about 30 percent of the votes (that's about one out of three voters).  Those other 70 percent of the Republican voters (two out of three) wanted someone other than Trump.</p>

<p>
Now here's the important part: we don't know which of the Republican candidates was really the most popular candidate!  That's because the ballots did not collect enough information.</p>

<p>
In order to get fair election results -- with the most popular candidate always winning -- we need to use ballots that collect more information.  Specifically we need to be using 1-2-3 ballots and
<a href="http://www.votefair.org/instant_pairwise_elimination.html">pairwise counting</a>.</p>

<p>
Expressed another way, lots of "Republicans" who voted for Trump during the general election regarded Trump as their second or third or fourth or fifth (or ...) choice, not their first choice.</p>

<p>
If that primary election had used 1-2-3 ballots and pairwise counting, we would have been able to correctly identify which Republican candidate was actually most popular.  Who would that have been?  We don't know -- because not enough information was collected.</p>

<p>
So what is going to happen in the 2020 presidential election?  There will be <b>major</b> vote splitting in the Democratic party primary.</p>

<p>
Here's the interesting part: the wealthy business owners who give the biggest campaign contributions to the Republican party also give big campaign contributions to Democratic candidates during the Democratic primary election.  Why?  To increase vote splitting among the candidates they don't like.  And they give bigger campaign contributions to the single "money-backed" candidate that (in backroom meetings) they have designated as their special-interest puppet (although not named with those words).</p>

<p>
Based on current information it looks to me like Joe Biden is being set up as the special-interest puppet.  And this election has so many reform-minded candidates that those big-money contributors don't have to spend any money to intentionally split the vote.  Specifically, there is going to be lots of vote splitting among the reform-minded candidates such as Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gilibrand, Beto O'Rorke, Bernie Sanders, and some others.  These candidates will split the votes of us voters who want major reforms (less corruption, fairer taxes, etc.) in Washington DC, making it easier for the money-backed candidate (Biden?) to win.</p>

<p>
If the money-backed tactic is successful, the same people who are providing lots of money to Joe Biden will switch to paying for ads that attack Joe Biden.  This will be easy to do.  (Biden is a nice guy, but he's got lots of flaws that can be exploited politically.)  This is the same strategy that was used against John Kerry, who was brought down by the "swift boat ads", which were paid for by some of the same people who gave him lots of money during his Democratic primary campaign.  (In that case John Edwards was the popular reform-minded candidate, and Howard Dean was the reform-minded candidate who was given money to split votes away from Edwards, although the funds to Dean were decreased when he looked like he might become more popular than Edwards.)</p>

<p>
So, assuming that "Democratic" voters want to know how to defeat Trump in the 2020 election, here is my opinion about what can be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Sign up to vote in the Democratic <b>primary</b> election.</li>

<li>
Cast your vote for a <b>reform-minded</b> candidate in the Democratic <b>primary</b> election <b>who has a chance of winning</b>.</li>

<li>
<b>Do not waste your vote for a can't win candidate</b>.  Because of how the ballots are counted, your ballot is not asking you to indicate your "favorite" candidate.  Instead your ballot is asking which single one of the most popular candidates you support.</li>

<li>
Do not be tempted to vote for the single big-money-backed candidate, who will be promoted glowingly on slick ads.  At this point <b>it looks like Joe Biden is being chosen as this special-interest puppet</b>.  The fact that Trump recently said he is most afraid of Biden being his general-election opponent is likely to be a lie-based tactic to attract primary-election votes to Biden.</li>

<li>
Watch carefully for evidence that Bernie Sanders is unknowingly being given money and online-poll votes from Russian hackers.  I've already seen suspicious evidence supporting this possibility.  Why would Valdimir Putin prefer Bernie?  <b>A large portion of the people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary then went on to vote for Trump in the general election!</b>  Also Bernie's age makes his health vulnerable to well-known Russian tactics.  And remember that <b>Bernie gained his popularity by being the only opponent to disliked, and clueless-about-DC-corruption, Hillary Clinton</b>, but in this election there are lots of other reform-minded candidates to choose from.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a clarification, I do not like any of the political parties.  And the distinction between "liberal" and "conservative" makes no sense to me.  I'm in favor of major reforms that would reduce corruption, and as a result, increase economic prosperity to most of us "average" folks.  Expressed another way, I care about the conflict between the 
<a href="http://www.votefair.org/pencil_metaphor.html">political up versus political down</a>
not the entertaining, attention-grabbing conflict between the political left and the political right.</p>

<p>
So, in conclusion, the best way to solve the political problems currently going on in Washington DC is to adopt 1-2-3 ballots and
<a href="http://www.votefair.org/instant_pairwise_elimination.html">pairwise counting</a>,
and then implement a pairwise-based form of
<a href="http://www.votefair.org/representative_instant_pairwise_elimination.html">proportional representation</a>,
and then get Congress to adopt
<a href="http://www.negotiationtool.com/cabinetministers.html">fairer voting methods within Congress</a>.</p>

<p>
Until that happens, <b>we need to prevent vote splitting by communicating with other voters, finding out which reform-minded candidate has the best chance of winning, and voting for that candidate</b>.  And not being tempted to vote for a can't win candidate just because you want your favorite to feel supported.  And not being tempted to vote for a third-party candidate in hopes of winning the prize money that political insiders have arranged to dangle in front of third-party candidates who split votes away from (usually) Democratic candidates.</p>
