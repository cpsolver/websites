Testimonials</h1></center>

<p>&ldquo;[The VoteFair American Idol poll] was the only one to consistently say Maddie was the most popular.&nbsp; It got tricky at the end, but his voting system did have Maddie winning in the final vote.&nbsp; Especially in retrospect, his commentary was very accurate week to week.&nbsp; ... [I] just reread a few of those posts and it was one of those "holy sh*t" moments.&nbsp; Super insightful analysis.&rdquo;&nbsp; u/jillanco on Reddit</p>


<p>
&ldquo;What you have created is very impressive
and I believe has potential to revolutionize US voting
and ultimately US and world history.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oliver S.</p>


<p>
&ldquo;I just came across your website and I absolutely love it.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; Keep up the great work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ken</p>


<p>
&ldquo;I really like your voting system, this is exactly what I was looking for.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stéphanie V. (in Belgium)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;Your site selected 20/30 bottom group contestants and 5/12 eliminated contestants correctly (excluding the finale).&nbsp; That's better than any other single index that I assessed, including Dialidol and Zabasearch.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Idol Analytics: American Idol predictions, statistics and analysis)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;A ranking ballot would be the best way to select someone for public office.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Israel Shenker)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;Your 'pencil' analysis [in <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S Elections</i>] was years ahead of its time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<a href="http://www.eduardhiebert.com/ereform/v123p.htm">Eduard Hiebert at www.eduardhiebert.com/ereform/v123p.htm</a>)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;Your site is great and exposes real problems with traditional voting.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Bill Gordon)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;... It shows the VoteFair voting approach is better than the current American Idol voting method.&nbsp; I like the idea of voting for a 1st, 2nd & 3rd choice.&nbsp; I think it could easily be implemented by American Idol.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Sleepy on IdolBlogLive.com forum)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;This VoteFair method is the most accurate voting system that has ever been made, I salute the person who conceptualized this whole thing.&nbsp;
... More power to this site, and may this system be noticed and applied by those who need it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (JPTD)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;I've succe$$fully bet the American Idol contest for several years, and I use your site as part of my handicapping.&nbsp;
Thanks!&rdquo;&nbsp; (TP, Minnesota)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;Our organization has had several successful elections (of club officers) in the past few years, including an annual election a couple of weeks ago with the most candidates ever, and all the results have been recognized as very fair.&nbsp; In the past few days we've had multiple simple polls going while we select a new team name for the upcoming season.&nbsp; Thanks again for keeping VoteFair going!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Allan Barber, San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;VoteFair's <a href="http://www.votefair.org/cgi-bin/votefairrank.cgi/votingid=51396-56423-10853">results</a> today (May 18, 2010) illustrate so clearly the difference between traditional voting and VoteFair's method.&nbsp; All three contestants have significant voting percentages under traditional voting method, but one of them (Casey James) has only a tiny part of VoteFair voting results.&nbsp; Excellent job!&rdquo;</p>


<p>
&ldquo;The [VoteFair American Idol] poll is one of the best tools around for tracking fanbase size and dedication.&rdquo; (chessguy99 on forum at IdolForums.com)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;I am really pleased with this site cause it is very accurate.&nbsp; Actually, I was sad to see Lilly [Scott] gone [from American Idol].&nbsp; BOOOOHOOOOO!!!!! *Weeps*&nbsp; People should really have voted for her!!&rdquo; (Terry Hartshire)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;Thanks for providing some keen insight on the nature of elections and voting.&nbsp; I'm a scientist with a mathematics background, who agrees that there ought to be a more equitable election system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love your [American Idol] polls.&nbsp; They are great fun, and also incredibly fascinating with their analysis.&rdquo; (James De Roxtra)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;My sister is a mathematician and has been telling me about this [balloting] system for years.&nbsp; Our family is shocked that the U.S. continues to use a 1700's voting system in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.&nbsp; Crazy!&rdquo;</p>


<p>
&ldquo;Our club is extremely pleased with multiple aspects of the VoteFair system.&nbsp; The ability to vote online meant an extremely high voter turnout, approximately 70-75%!&nbsp; Equally as important are the concepts underlying the VoteFair system.&nbsp; Using a comparison system instead of the more common method of voting for a single candidate we came out knowing that we had voted in the candidates our club members preferred to have in the seats.&nbsp; Not only were there a number of good candidates, which could have split a conventional vote to the point of electing a non-preferred candidate, but our club is essentially split between 2 facilities and some candidates were known better in one or other of the facilities.&nbsp; VoteFair [ranking] gave us the ability to balance that out transparently.&nbsp; Thanks!&rdquo;&nbsp; (Allan Barber, San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;I really enjoy the analysis and support your cause....&nbsp; I am a Mathematician at heart and by degree.&nbsp; I do enjoy, appreciate and back the message you are sending to your audience.&nbsp; It is sad in a way that real life events such as the Presidential elections share the same flaws as a reality TV program.&nbsp; (I don't think David Cook will be sending out troops to War, but they may enjoy his entertainment.)&nbsp; What makes your column enjoyable to me is [that] not only do you point out the obvious flaw of &ldquo;first[-choice] vote&rdquo;, but also those intangibles that exist in human nature (plurality) and phone usage (teen texting).&nbsp; Keep spreading awareness and just maybe we'll nominate the right guy or gal for the job!&rdquo;&nbsp; (J.F.)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;[This is] a website that seems to have figured out the fairest way of counting preferential votes.&nbsp; I haven't found a better site on this subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Andrew at www.tifor.net)</p>


<p>
&ldquo;Yesterday, you said 'Chris and Elliott are vulnerable' (to be eliminated).&nbsp; I never believed Chris was vulnerable.&nbsp; Your prediction was correct...amazing.&nbsp; I have to give you credit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good Site! Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
